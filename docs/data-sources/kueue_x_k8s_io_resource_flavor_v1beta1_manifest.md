# k8s_kueue_x_k8s_io_resource_flavor_v1beta1_manifest (Data Source)

ResourceFlavor is the Schema for the resourceflavors API.

## Example Usage

data "k8s_kueue_x_k8s_io_resource_flavor_v1beta1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name = "some-name"

  }

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) ResourceFlavorSpec defines the desired state of the ResourceFlavor (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.name`.
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `node_labels` (Map of String) nodeLabels are labels that associate the ResourceFlavor with Nodes that have the same labels. When a Workload is admitted, its podsets can only get assigned ResourceFlavors whose nodeLabels match the nodeSelector and nodeAffinity fields. Once a ResourceFlavor is assigned to a podSet, the ResourceFlavor's nodeLabels should be injected into the pods of the Workload by the controller that integrates with the Workload object.  nodeLabels can be up to 8 elements.
- `node_taints` (Attributes List) nodeTaints are taints that the nodes associated with this ResourceFlavor have. Workloads' podsets must have tolerations for these nodeTaints in order to get assigned this ResourceFlavor during admission.  An example of a nodeTaint is cloud.provider.com/preemptible='true':NoSchedule  nodeTaints can be up to 8 elements. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--node_taints))

### Nested Schema for `spec.node_taints`

Required:

- `effect` (String) Required. The effect of the taint on pods that do not tolerate the taint. Valid effects are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Required. The taint key to be applied to a node.

Optional:

- `time_added` (String) TimeAdded represents the time at which the taint was added. It is only written for NoExecute taints.
- `value` (String) The taint value corresponding to the taint key.
