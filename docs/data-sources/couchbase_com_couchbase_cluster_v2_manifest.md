- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `image` (String) Image is the container image name that will be used to launch Couchbaseserver instances.  Updating this field will cause an automatic upgrade ofthe cluster. Explicitly specifying the image for a server class will overridethis value for the server class.
- `security` (Attributes) Security defines Couchbase cluster security options such as the administratoraccount username and password, and user RBAC settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--security))
- `servers` (Attributes List) Servers defines server classes for the Operator to provision and manage.A server class defines what services are running and how many members makeup that class.  Specifying multiple server classes allows the Operator toprovision clusters with Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS).  At least one serverclass must be defined, and at least one server class must be running the dataservice. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--servers))

Optional:

- `anti_affinity` (Boolean) AntiAffinity forces the Operator to schedule different Couchbase server pods ondifferent Kubernetes nodes.  Anti-affinity reduces the likelihood of unrecoverablefailure in the event of a node issue.  Use of anti-affinity is highly recommended forproduction clusters.
- `auto_resource_allocation` (Attributes) AutoResourceAllocation populates pod resource requests based on the services runningon that pod.  When enabled, this feature will calculate the memory request as thetotal of service allocations defined in 'spec.cluster', plus an overhead definedby 'spec.autoResourceAllocation.overheadPercent'.Changing individual allocations fora service will cause a cluster upgrade as allocations are modified in the underlyingpods.  This field also allows default pod CPU requests and limits to be applied.All resource allocations can be overridden by explicitly configuring them in the'spec.servers.resources' field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--auto_resource_allocation))
- `autoscale_stabilization_period` (String) AutoscaleStabilizationPeriod defines how long after a rebalance thecorresponding HorizontalPodAutoscaler should remain in maintenance mode.During maintenance mode all autoscaling is disabled since every HorizontalPodAutoscalerassociated with the cluster becomes inactive.Since certain metrics can be unpredictable when Couchbase is rebalancing or upgrading,setting a stabilization period helps to prevent scaling recommendations from theHorizontalPodAutoscaler for a provided period of time.Values must be a valid Kubernetes duration of 0s or higher:https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDurationA value of 0, puts the cluster in maintenance mode during rebalance butimmediately exits this mode once the rebalance has completed.When undefined, the HPA is never put into maintenance mode during rebalance.

- `recovery_policy` (String) RecoveryPolicy controls how aggressive the Operator is when recovering clustertopology.  When PrioritizeDataIntegrity, the Operator will delegate failoverexclusively to Couchbase server, relying on it to only allow recovery when safe todo so.  When PrioritizeUptime, the Operator will wait for a period after theexpected auto-failover of the cluster, before forcefully failing-over the pods.This may cause data loss, and is only expected to be used on clusters with ephemeraldata, where the loss of the pod means that the data is known to be unrecoverable.This field must be either 'PrioritizeDataIntegrity' or 'PrioritizeUptime', defaultingto 'PrioritizeDataIntegrity'.

By default, mostcloud providers will label nodes with the key 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone',the values associated with that key are used here to provide explicitscheduling by the Operator.  You may manually label nodes using the'topology.kubernetes.io/zone' key, to provide failure-domainaware scheduling when none is provided for you.  Global server groups areapplied to all server classes, and may be overridden on a per-server classbasis to give more control over scheduling and server groups.

When InPlaceUpgrade is requested, the operator willperform an in-place upgrade on a best effort basis. InPlaceUpgrade cannot be used if the UpgradeStrategyis set to ImmediateUpgrade.
- `upgrade_strategy` (String) UpgradeStrategy controls how aggressive the Operator is when performing a clusterupgrade.  When a rolling upgrade is requested, pods are upgraded one at a time.  Thisstrategy is slower, however less disruptive.  When an immediate upgrade strategy isrequested, all pods are upgraded at the same time.  This strategy is faster, but moredisruptive.  This field must be either 'RollingUpgrade' or 'ImmediateUpgrade', defaultingto 'RollingUpgrade'.
- `volume_claim_templates` (Attributes List) VolumeClaimTemplates define the desired characteristics of a volumethat can be requested/claimed by a pod, for example the storage class touse and the volume size.

### Nested Schema for `spec.servers.pod.spec.tolerations`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod cantolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must beof effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero andnegative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--servers--pod--spec--topology_spread_constraints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.servers.pod.spec.topology_spread_constraints`

Required:

- `max_skew` (Number) MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.When 'whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule', it is the maximum permitted differencebetween the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domainor zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the samelabelSelector spread as 2/2/1:In this case, the global minimum is 1.| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 ||  P P  |  P P  |   P   |- if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)violate MaxSkew(1).- if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.When 'whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway', it is used to give higher precedenceto topologies that satisfy it.It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
- `topology_key` (String) TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this keyand identical values are considered to be in the same topology.We consider each <key, value> as a 'bucket', and try to put balanced numberof pods into each bucket.We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements ofnodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.e.g. If TopologyKey is 'kubernetes.io/hostname', each Node is a domain of that topology.And, if TopologyKey is 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', each zone is a domain of that topology.It's a required field.
- `when_unsatisfiable` (String) WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfythe spread constraint.- DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.- ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the  skew.A constraint is considered 'Unsatisfiable' for an incoming podif and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate'MaxSkew' on some topology.For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the samelabelSelector spread as 3/1/1:| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 || P P P |   P   |   P   |If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduledto zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfiesMaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but schedulerwon't make it *more* imbalanced.It's a required field.

Optional:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector is used to find matching pods.Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of podsin their corresponding topology domain. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--servers--pod--spec--topology_spread_constraints--label_selector))
- `match_label_keys` (List of String) MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over whichspreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from theincoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelectorto select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculatedfor the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels willbe ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `min_domains` (Number) MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,Pod Topology Spread treats 'global minimum' as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,this value has no effect on scheduling.As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.Valid values are integers greater than 0.When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the samelabelSelector spread as 2/2/2:| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 ||  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so 'global minimum' is treated as 0.In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,it will violate MaxSkew.This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `node_affinity_policy` (String) NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelectorwhen calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are:- Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations.- Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy.This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
- `node_taints_policy` (String) NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculatingpod topology spread skew. Options are:- Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming podhas a toleration, are included.- Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

The logs claim cannot be used at the sametime as the default claim within the same server class.  This field references a volumeclaim template name as defined in 'spec.volumeClaimTemplates'.Whilst the logs claim can be used with the search service, the recommendation is to use thedefault claim for these. The reason for this is that a failure of these nodes will requireindexes to be rebuilt and subsequent performance impact.

- `synchronize` (Boolean) Synchronize allows unmanaged buckets, scopes, and collections to be synchronized asKubernetes resources by the Operator.  This feature is intended for development onlyand should not be used for production workloads.  The synchronization workflow startswith 'spec.buckets.managed' being set to false, the user can manually create buckets,scopes, and collections using the Couchbase UI, or other tooling.  When you wish tocommit to Kubernetes resources, you must specify a unique label selector in the'spec.buckets.selector' field, and this field is set to true.  The Operator willcreate Kubernetes resources for you, and upon completion set the cluster's 'Synchronized'status condition. Synchronizing will not create a Kubernetes resource for the CouchbaseServer maintained _system scope. You may then safely set 'spec.buckets.managed' totrue and the Operator will manage these resources as per usual.  To update an alreadymanaged data topology, you must first set it to unmanaged, make any changes, and deleteany old resources, then follow the standard synchronization workflow.  The Operatorcan not, and will not, ever delete, or make modifications to resource specificationsthat are intended to be user managed, or managed by a life cycle management tool. Theseactions must be instigated by an end user.  For a more complete experience, refer tothe documentation for the 'cao save' and 'cao restore' CLI commands.

### Nested Schema for `spec.networking.admin_console_service_template.spec`

Optional:

- `allocate_load_balancer_node_ports` (Boolean) allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts defines if NodePorts will be automaticallyallocated for services with type LoadBalancer.  Default is 'true'. Itmay be set to 'false' if the cluster load-balancer does not rely onNodePorts.  If the caller requests specific NodePorts (by specifying avalue), those requests will be respected, regardless of this field.This field may only be set for services with type LoadBalancer and willbe cleared if the type is changed to any other type.
- `cluster_i_ps` (List of String) ClusterIPs is a list of IP addresses assigned to this service, and areusually assigned randomly.  If an address is specified manually, isin-range (as per system configuration), and is not in use, it will beallocated to the service; otherwise creation of the service will fail.This field may not be changed through updates unless the type field isalso being changed to ExternalName (which requires this field to beempty) or the type field is being changed from ExternalName (in whichcase this field may optionally be specified, as describe above).  Validvalues are 'None', empty string (''), or a valid IP address.  Settingthis to 'None' makes a 'headless service' (no virtual IP), which isuseful when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying isnot required.  Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, andLoadBalancer. If this field is specified when creating a Service of typeExternalName, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updatinga Service to type ExternalName.  If this field is not specified, it willbe initialized from the clusterIP field.  If this field is specified,clients must ensure that clusterIPs[0] and clusterIP have the samevalue.This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack IPs, in either order).These IPs must correspond to the values of the ipFamilies field. BothclusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `cluster_ip` (String) clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assignedrandomly. If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as persystem configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to theservice; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field may notbe changed through updates unless the type field is also being changedto ExternalName (which requires this field to be blank) or the typefield is being changed from ExternalName (in which case this field mayoptionally be specified, as describe above).  Valid values are 'None',empty string (''), or a valid IP address. Setting this to 'None' makes a'headless service' (no virtual IP), which is useful when direct endpointconnections are preferred and proxying is not required.  Only applies totypes ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specifiedwhen creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. Thisfield will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `external_i_ps` (List of String) externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the clusterwill also accept traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed byKubernetes.  The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrivesat a node with this IP.  A common example is external load-balancersthat are not part of the Kubernetes system.
- `external_name` (String) externalName is the external reference that discovery mechanisms willreturn as an alias for this service (e.g. a DNS CNAME record). Noproxying will be involved.  Must be a lowercase RFC-1123 hostname(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires 'type' to be 'ExternalName'.
- `external_traffic_policy` (String) externalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic theyreceive on one of the Service's 'externally-facing' addresses (NodePorts,ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to 'Local', the proxy will configurethe service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take careof balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will delivertraffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masqueradingthe client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints willbe dropped.) The default value, 'Cluster', uses the standard behavior ofrouting to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and otherfeatures). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP fromwithin the cluster will always get 'Cluster' semantics, but clients sending toa NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into accountwhen picking a node.
- `health_check_node_port` (Number) healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service.This only applies when type is set to LoadBalancer andexternalTrafficPolicy is set to Local. If a value is specified, isin-range, and is not in use, it will be used.  If not specified, a valuewill be automatically allocated.  External systems (e.g. load-balancers)can use this port to determine if a given node holds endpoints for thisservice or not.  If this field is specified when creating a Servicewhich does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wipedwhen updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type).This field cannot be updated once set.
- `internal_traffic_policy` (String) InternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic theyreceive on the ClusterIP. If set to 'Local', the proxy will assume that podsonly want to talk to endpoints of the service on the same node as the pod,dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value,'Cluster', uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly(possibly modified by topology and other features).
- `ip_families` (List of String) IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to thisservice. This field is usually assigned automatically based on clusterconfiguration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If this field is specifiedmanually, the requested family is available in the cluster,and ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation ofthe service will fail. This field is conditionally mutable: it allowsfor adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not allowchanging the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are 'IPv4'and 'IPv6'.  This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP,NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to 'headless' services.This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, ineither order).  These families must correspond to the values of theclusterIPs field, if specified. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies aregoverned by the ipFamilyPolicy field.
- `ip_family_policy` (String) IPFamilyPolicy represents the dual-stack-ness requested or required bythis Service. If there is no value provided, then this field will be setto SingleStack. Services can be 'SingleStack' (a single IP family),'PreferDualStack' (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters ora single IP family on single-stack clusters), or 'RequireDualStack'(two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters, otherwise fail).

Unprefixed names are reserved for end-users.This field can only be set when the Service type is 'LoadBalancer'. If not set, the default loadbalancer implementation is used, today this is typically done through the cloud provider integration,but should apply for any default implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancerimplementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancerimplementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field.This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type 'LoadBalancer'.Once set, it can not be changed. This field will be wiped when a service is updated to a non 'LoadBalancer' type.
- `load_balancer_ip` (String) Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer.This feature depends on whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifyingthe loadBalancerIP when a load balancer is created.This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.Deprecated: This field was under-specified and its meaning varies across implementations.Using it is non-portable and it may not support dual-stack.Users are encouraged to use implementation-specific annotations when available.

### Nested Schema for `spec.networking.exposed_feature_service_template.spec`

Optional:

- `allocate_load_balancer_node_ports` (Boolean) allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts defines if NodePorts will be automaticallyallocated for services with type LoadBalancer.  Default is 'true'. Itmay be set to 'false' if the cluster load-balancer does not rely onNodePorts.  If the caller requests specific NodePorts (by specifying avalue), those requests will be respected, regardless of this field.This field may only be set for services with type LoadBalancer and willbe cleared if the type is changed to any other type.
- `cluster_i_ps` (List of String) ClusterIPs is a list of IP addresses assigned to this service, and areusually assigned randomly.  If an address is specified manually, isin-range (as per system configuration), and is not in use, it will beallocated to the service; otherwise creation of the service will fail.This field may not be changed through updates unless the type field isalso being changed to ExternalName (which requires this field to beempty) or the type field is being changed from ExternalName (in whichcase this field may optionally be specified, as describe above).  Validvalues are 'None', empty string (''), or a valid IP address.  Settingthis to 'None' makes a 'headless service' (no virtual IP), which isuseful when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying isnot required.  Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, andLoadBalancer. If this field is specified when creating a Service of typeExternalName, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updatinga Service to type ExternalName.  If this field is not specified, it willbe initialized from the clusterIP field.  If this field is specified,clients must ensure that clusterIPs[0] and clusterIP have the samevalue.This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack IPs, in either order).These IPs must correspond to the values of the ipFamilies field. BothclusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `cluster_ip` (String) clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assignedrandomly. If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as persystem configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to theservice; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field may notbe changed through updates unless the type field is also being changedto ExternalName (which requires this field to be blank) or the typefield is being changed from ExternalName (in which case this field mayoptionally be specified, as describe above).  Valid values are 'None',empty string (''), or a valid IP address. Setting this to 'None' makes a'headless service' (no virtual IP), which is useful when direct endpointconnections are preferred and proxying is not required.  Only applies totypes ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specifiedwhen creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. Thisfield will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `external_i_ps` (List of String) externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the clusterwill also accept traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed byKubernetes.

- `external_name` (String) externalName is the external reference that discovery mechanisms willreturn as an alias for this service (e.g. a DNS CNAME record). Noproxying will be involved.  Must be a lowercase RFC-1123 hostname(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires 'type' to be 'ExternalName'.
- `external_traffic_policy` (String) externalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic theyreceive on one of the Service's 'externally-facing' addresses (NodePorts,ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to 'Local', the proxy will configurethe service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take careof balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will delivertraffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masqueradingthe client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints willbe dropped.) The default value, 'Cluster', uses the standard behavior ofrouting to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and otherfeatures). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP fromwithin the cluster will always get 'Cluster' semantics, but clients sending toa NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into accountwhen picking a node.
- `health_check_node_port` (Number) healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service.This only applies when type is set to LoadBalancer andexternalTrafficPolicy is set to Local. If a value is specified, isin-range, and is not in use, it will be used.  If not specified, a valuewill be automatically allocated.  External systems (e.g. load-balancers)can use this port to determine if a given node holds endpoints for thisservice or not.  If this field is specified when creating a Servicewhich does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wipedwhen updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type).This field cannot be updated once set.
- `internal_traffic_policy` (String) InternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic theyreceive on the ClusterIP. If set to 'Local', the proxy will assume that podsonly want to talk to endpoints of the service on the same node as the pod,dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value,'Cluster', uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly(possibly modified by topology and other features).
- `ip_families` (List of String) IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to thisservice. This field is usually assigned automatically based on clusterconfiguration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If this field is specifiedmanually, the requested family is available in the cluster,and ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation ofthe service will fail. This field is conditionally mutable: it allowsfor adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not allowchanging the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are 'IPv4'and 'IPv6'.  This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP,NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to 'headless' services.This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, ineither order).  These families must correspond to the values of theclusterIPs field, if specified. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies aregoverned by the ipFamilyPolicy field.
- `ip_family_policy` (String) IPFamilyPolicy represents the dual-stack-ness requested or required bythis Service. If there is no value provided, then this field will be setto SingleStack. Services can be 'SingleStack' (a single IP family),'PreferDualStack' (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters ora single IP family on single-stack clusters), or 'RequireDualStack'(two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters, otherwise fail). TheipFamilies and clusterIPs fields depend on the value of this field. Thisfield will be wiped when updating a service to type ExternalName.
- `load_balancer_class` (String) loadBalancerClass is the class of the load balancer implementation this Service belongs to.If specified, the value of this field must be a label-style identifier, with an optional prefix,e.g. 'internal-vip' or 'example.com/internal-vip'. Unprefixed names are reserved for end-users.This field can only be set when the Service type is 'LoadBalancer'.

When all, all traffic is encrypted, including database documents.When strict mode is used, it is the same as all, but also disables all plaintextports.  Strict mode is only available on Couchbase Server versions 7.1 and greater.Node to node encryption can only be used when TLS certificates are managed by theOperator.  This field must be either 'ControlPlaneOnly', 'All', or 'Strict'.

This may be any object from a non-empty API group (noncore object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type ofthe specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamicprovisioner.This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as suchif both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwardscompatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the samevalue automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is  specified.* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects  in any namespaces.(Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.(Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
