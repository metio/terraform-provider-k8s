  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) The API group of the requested resource.
- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.name`.
- `kind` (String) The type of the requested resource.
- `spec` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Read-Only:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Read-Only:

- `destination_cid_rs` (List of String) DestinationCIDRs is a list of destination CIDRs for destination IP addresses. If a destination IP matches any one CIDR, it will be selected.
- `egress_gateway` (Attributes) EgressGateway is the gateway node responsible for SNATing traffic. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress_gateway))
- `excluded_cid_rs` (List of String) ExcludedCIDRs is a list of destination CIDRs that will be excluded from the egress gateway redirection and SNAT logic. Should be a subset of destinationCIDRs otherwise it will not have any effect.
- `selectors` (Attributes List) Egress represents a list of rules by which egress traffic is filtered from the source pods. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--selectors))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--egress_gateway"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.egress_gateway`

Read-Only:

- `egress_ip` (String) EgressIP is the source IP address that the egress traffic is SNATed with.  Example: When set to '192.168.1.100', matching egress traffic will be redirected to the node matching the NodeSelector field and SNATed with IP address 192.168.1.100.  When none of the Interface or EgressIP fields is specified, the policy will use the first IPv4 assigned to the interface with the default route.
- `interface` (String) Interface is the network interface to which the egress IP address that the traffic is SNATed with is assigned.  Example: When set to 'eth1', matching egress traffic will be redirected to the node matching the NodeSelector field and SNATed with the first IPv4 address assigned to the eth1 interface.  When none of the Interface or EgressIP fields is specified, the policy will use the first IPv4 assigned to the interface with the default route.
- `node_selector` (Attributes) This is a label selector which selects the node that should act as egress gateway for the given policy. In case multiple nodes are selected, only the first one in the lexical ordering over the node names will be used. This field follows standard label selector semantics. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress_gateway--node_selector))

### Nested Schema for `spec.egress_gateway.node_selector`

Read-Only:

- `match_expressions` (Attributes List) matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress_gateway--node_selector--match_expressions))
- `match_labels` (Map of String) matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--egress_gateway--node_selector--match_expressions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.egress_gateway.node_selector.match_labels`

Read-Only:

- `key` (String) key is the label key that the selector applies to.
- `operator` (String) operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.
- `values` (List of String) values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.




<a id="nestedatt--spec--selectors"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.selectors`

Read-Only:

- `namespace_selector` (Attributes) Selects Namespaces using cluster-scoped labels. This field follows standard label selector semantics; if present but empty, it selects all namespaces. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--selectors--namespace_selector))
- `pod_selector` (Attributes) This is a label selector which selects Pods. This field follows standard label selector semantics; if present but empty, it selects all pods. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--selectors--pod_selector))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--selectors--namespace_selector"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.selectors.namespace_selector`

Read-Only:

- `match_expressions` (Attributes List) matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--selectors--namespace_selector--match_expressions))
- `match_labels` (Map of String) matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.

### Nested Schema for `spec.selectors.namespace_selector.match_labels`

Read-Only:
