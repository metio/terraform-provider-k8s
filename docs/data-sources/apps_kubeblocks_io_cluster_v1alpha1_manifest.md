### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) ClusterSpec defines the desired state of Cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `termination_policy` (String) Specifies the behavior when a Cluster is deleted. It defines how resources, data, and backups associated with a Cluster are managed during termination. Choose a policy based on the desired level of resource cleanup and data preservation: - 'DoNotTerminate': Prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact. - 'Halt': Deletes Cluster resources like Pods and Services but retains Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), allowing for data preservation while stopping other operations. Warning: Halt policy is deprecated in 0.9.1 and will have same meaning as DoNotTerminate. - 'Delete': Extends the 'Halt' policy by also removing PVCs, leading to a thorough cleanup while removing all persistent data. - 'WipeOut': An aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and backups in external storage. This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments to avoid irreversible data loss. Warning: Choosing an inappropriate termination policy can result in data loss. The 'WipeOut' policy is particularly risky in production environments due to its irreversible nature.

Optional:

- `affinity` (Attributes) Defines a set of node affinity scheduling rules for the Cluster's Pods. This field helps control the placement of Pods on nodes within the Cluster. Deprecated since v0.10. Use the 'schedulingPolicy' field instead. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--affinity))
- `availability_policy` (String) Describes the availability policy, including zone, node, and none. Deprecated since v0.9. This field is maintained for backward compatibility and its use is discouraged. Existing usage should be updated to the current preferred approach to avoid compatibility issues in future releases.
- `backup` (Attributes) Specifies the backup configuration of the Cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--backup))
- `cluster_definition_ref` (String) Specifies the name of the ClusterDefinition to use when creating a Cluster. This field enables users to create a Cluster based on a specific ClusterDefinition. Which, in conjunction with the 'topology' field, determine: - The Components to be included in the Cluster. - The sequences in which the Components are created, updated, and terminate. This facilitates multiple-components management with predefined ClusterDefinition. Users with advanced requirements can bypass this general setting and specify more precise control over the composition of the Cluster by directly referencing specific ComponentDefinitions for each component within 'componentSpecs[*].componentDef'. If this field is not provided, each component must be explicitly defined in 'componentSpecs[*].componentDef'. Note: Once set, this field cannot be modified; it is immutable.
- `cluster_version_ref` (String) Refers to the ClusterVersion name. Deprecated since v0.9, use ComponentVersion instead. This field is maintained for backward compatibility and its use is discouraged. Existing usage should be updated to the current preferred approach to avoid compatibility issues in future releases.
- `component_specs` (Attributes List) Specifies a list of ClusterComponentSpec objects used to define the individual Components that make up a Cluster. This field allows for detailed configuration of each Component within the Cluster. Note: 'shardingSpecs' and 'componentSpecs' cannot both be empty; at least one must be defined to configure a Cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs))
- `network` (Attributes) The configuration of network. Deprecated since v0.9. This field is maintained for backward compatibility and its use is discouraged. Existing usage should be updated to the current preferred approach to avoid compatibility issues in future releases. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network))
- `replicas` (Number) Specifies the replicas of the first componentSpec, if the replicas of the first componentSpec is specified, this value will be ignored. Deprecated since v0.9. This field is maintained for backward compatibility and its use is discouraged. Existing usage should be updated to the current preferred approach to avoid compatibility issues in future releases.
- `resources` (Attributes) Specifies the resources of the first componentSpec, if the resources of the first componentSpec is specified, this value will be ignored. Deprecated since v0.9. This field is maintained for backward compatibility and its use is discouraged. Existing usage should be updated to the current preferred approach to avoid compatibility issues in future releases. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--resources))
- `runtime_class_name` (String) Specifies runtimeClassName for all Pods managed by this Cluster.
- `scheduling_policy` (Attributes) Specifies the scheduling policy for the Cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--scheduling_policy))
- `services` (Map of String) Defines a list of additional Services that are exposed by a Cluster. This field allows Services of selected Components, either from 'componentSpecs' or 'shardingSpecs' to be exposed, alongside Services defined with ComponentService. Services defined here can be referenced by other clusters using the ServiceRefClusterSelector.
- `sharding_specs` (Attributes List) Specifies a list of ShardingSpec objects that manage the sharding topology for Cluster Components. Each ShardingSpec organizes components into shards, with each shard corresponding to a Component. Components within a shard are all based on a common ClusterComponentSpec template, ensuring uniform configurations. This field supports dynamic resharding by facilitating the addition or removal of shards through the 'shards' field in ShardingSpec. Note: 'shardingSpecs' and 'componentSpecs' cannot both be empty; at least one must be defined to configure a Cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs))
- `storage` (Attributes) Specifies the storage of the first componentSpec, if the storage of the first componentSpec is specified, this value will be ignored. Deprecated since v0.9. This field is maintained for backward compatibility and its use is discouraged. Existing usage should be updated to the current preferred approach to avoid compatibility issues in future releases. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage))
- `tenancy` (String) Describes how Pods are distributed across node. Deprecated since v0.9. This field is maintained for backward compatibility and its use is discouraged. Existing usage should be updated to the current preferred approach to avoid compatibility issues in future releases.
- `tolerations` (Map of String) An array that specifies tolerations attached to the Cluster's Pods, allowing them to be scheduled onto nodes with matching taints. Deprecated since v0.10. Use the 'schedulingPolicy' field instead.
- `topology` (String) Specifies the name of the ClusterTopology to be used when creating the Cluster. This field defines which set of Components, as outlined in the ClusterDefinition, will be used to construct the Cluster based on the named topology. The ClusterDefinition may list multiple topologies under 'clusterdefinition.spec.topologies[*]', each tailored to different use cases or environments. If 'topology' is not specified, the Cluster will use the default topology defined in the ClusterDefinition. Note: Once set during the Cluster creation, the 'topology' field cannot be modified. It establishes the initial composition and structure of the Cluster and is intended for one-time configuration.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--affinity"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.affinity`

Optional:

- `node_labels` (Map of String) Indicates the node labels that must be present on nodes for pods to be scheduled on them. It is a map where the keys are the label keys and the values are the corresponding label values. Pods will only be scheduled on nodes that have all the specified labels with the corresponding values. For example, if NodeLabels is set to {'nodeType': 'ssd', 'environment': 'production'}, pods will only be scheduled on nodes that have both the 'nodeType' label with value 'ssd' and the 'environment' label with value 'production'. This field allows users to control Pod placement based on specific node labels. It can be used to ensure that Pods are scheduled on nodes with certain characteristics, such as specific hardware (e.g., SSD), environment (e.g., production, staging), or any other custom labels assigned to nodes.
- `pod_anti_affinity` (String) Specifies the anti-affinity level of Pods within a Component. It determines how pods should be spread across nodes to improve availability and performance. It can have the following values: 'Preferred' and 'Required'. The default value is 'Preferred'.
- `tenancy` (String) Determines the level of resource isolation between Pods. It can have the following values: 'SharedNode' and 'DedicatedNode'. - SharedNode: Allow that multiple Pods may share the same node, which is the default behavior of K8s. - DedicatedNode: Each Pod runs on a dedicated node, ensuring that no two Pods share the same node. In other words, if a Pod is already running on a node, no other Pods will be scheduled on that node. Which provides a higher level of isolation and resource guarantee for Pods. The default value is 'SharedNode'.
- `topology_keys` (List of String) Represents the key of node labels used to define the topology domain for Pod anti-affinity and Pod spread constraints. In K8s, a topology domain is a set of nodes that have the same value for a specific label key. Nodes with labels containing any of the specified TopologyKeys and identical values are considered to be in the same topology domain. Note: The concept of topology in the context of K8s TopologyKeys is different from the concept of topology in the ClusterDefinition. When a Pod has anti-affinity or spread constraints specified, Kubernetes will attempt to schedule the Pod on nodes with different values for the specified TopologyKeys. This ensures that Pods are spread across different topology domains, promoting high availability and reducing the impact of node failures. Some well-known label keys, such as 'kubernetes.io/hostname' and 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', are often used as TopologyKey. These keys represent the hostname and zone of a node, respectively. By including these keys in the TopologyKeys list, Pods will be spread across nodes with different hostnames or zones. In addition to the well-known keys, users can also specify custom label keys as TopologyKeys. This allows for more flexible and custom topology definitions based on the specific needs of the application or environment. The TopologyKeys field is a slice of strings, where each string represents a label key. The order of the keys in the slice does not matter.

### Nested Schema for `spec.backup`

Required:

- `method` (String) Specifies the backup method to use, as defined in backupPolicy.

Optional:

- `cron_expression` (String) The cron expression for the schedule. The timezone is in UTC. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Specifies whether automated backup is enabled for the Cluster.
- `pitr_enabled` (Boolean) Specifies whether to enable point-in-time recovery.
- `repo_name` (String) Specifies the name of the backupRepo. If not set, the default backupRepo will be used.
- `retention_period` (String) Determines the duration to retain backups. Backups older than this period are automatically removed. For example, RetentionPeriod of '30d' will keep only the backups of last 30 days. Sample duration format: - years: 2y - months: 6mo - days: 30d - hours: 12h - minutes: 30m You can also combine the above durations. For example: 30d12h30m. Default value is 7d.
- `starting_deadline_minutes` (Number) Specifies the maximum time in minutes that the system will wait to start a missed backup job. If the scheduled backup time is missed for any reason, the backup job must start within this deadline. Values must be between 0 (immediate execution) and 1440 (one day).


<a id="nestedatt--spec--component_specs"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.component_specs`

Required:

- `replicas` (Number) Specifies the desired number of replicas in the Component for enhancing availability and durability, or load balancing.

Optional:

- `affinity` (Attributes) Specifies a group of affinity scheduling rules for the Component. It allows users to control how the Component's Pods are scheduled onto nodes in the K8s cluster. Deprecated since v0.10, replaced by the 'schedulingPolicy' field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--affinity))
- `annotations` (Map of String) Specifies Annotations to override or add for underlying Pods, PVCs, Account & TLS Secrets, Services Owned by Component.
- `class_def_ref` (Attributes) References the class defined in ComponentClassDefinition. Deprecated since v0.9. This field is maintained for backward compatibility and its use is discouraged. Existing usage should be updated to the current preferred approach to avoid compatibility issues in future releases. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--class_def_ref))
- `component_def` (String) Specifies the exact name, name prefix, or regular expression pattern for matching the name of the ComponentDefinition custom resource (CR) that defines the Component's characteristics and behavior. If both 'componentDefRef' and 'componentDef' are provided, the 'componentDef' will take precedence over 'componentDefRef'.
- `component_def_ref` (String) References a ClusterComponentDefinition defined in the 'clusterDefinition.spec.componentDef' field. Must comply with the IANA service naming rule. Deprecated since v0.9, because defining Components in 'clusterDefinition.spec.componentDef' field has been deprecated. This field is replaced by the 'componentDef' field, use 'componentDef' instead. This field is maintained for backward compatibility and its use is discouraged. Existing usage should be updated to the current preferred approach to avoid compatibility issues in future releases. TODO +kubebuilder:validation:XValidation:rule='self == oldSelf',message='componentDefRef is immutable'
- `configs` (Attributes List) Specifies the configuration content of a config template. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--configs))
- `disable_exporter` (Boolean) Determines whether metrics exporter information is annotated on the Component's headless Service. If set to true, the following annotations will not be patched into the Service: - 'monitor.kubeblocks.io/path' - 'monitor.kubeblocks.io/port' - 'monitor.kubeblocks.io/scheme' These annotations allow the Prometheus installed by KubeBlocks to discover and scrape metrics from the exporter.
- `enabled_logs` (List of String) Specifies which types of logs should be collected for the Component. The log types are defined in the 'componentDefinition.spec.logConfigs' field with the LogConfig entries. The elements in the 'enabledLogs' array correspond to the names of the LogConfig entries. For example, if the 'componentDefinition.spec.logConfigs' defines LogConfig entries with names 'slow_query_log' and 'error_log', you can enable the collection of these logs by including their names in the 'enabledLogs' array: '''yaml enabledLogs: - slow_query_log - error_log '''
- `env` (Attributes List) List of environment variables to add. These environment variables will be placed after the environment variables declared in the Pod. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--env))
- `instance_update_strategy` (Attributes) Indicates the InstanceUpdateStrategy that will be employed to update Pods in the InstanceSet when a revision is made to Template. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--instance_update_strategy))
- `instances` (Attributes List) Allows for the customization of configuration values for each instance within a Component. An instance represent a single replica (Pod and associated K8s resources like PVCs, Services, and ConfigMaps). While instances typically share a common configuration as defined in the ClusterComponentSpec, they can require unique settings in various scenarios: For example: - A database Component might require different resource allocations for primary and secondary instances, with primaries needing more resources. - During a rolling upgrade, a Component may first update the image for one or a few instances, and then update the remaining instances after verifying that the updated instances are functioning correctly. InstanceTemplate allows for specifying these unique configurations per instance. Each instance's name is constructed using the pattern: $(component.name)-$(template.name)-$(ordinal), starting with an ordinal of 0. It is crucial to maintain unique names for each InstanceTemplate to avoid conflicts. The sum of replicas across all InstanceTemplates should not exceed the total number of replicas specified for the Component. Any remaining replicas will be generated using the default template and will follow the default naming rules. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--instances))
- `issuer` (Attributes) Specifies the configuration for the TLS certificates issuer. It allows defining the issuer name and the reference to the secret containing the TLS certificates and key. The secret should contain the CA certificate, TLS certificate, and private key in the specified keys. Required when TLS is enabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--issuer))
- `labels` (Map of String) Specifies Labels to override or add for underlying Pods, PVCs, Account & TLS Secrets, Services Owned by Component.
- `monitor` (Boolean) Deprecated since v0.9 Determines whether metrics exporter information is annotated on the Component's headless Service. If set to true, the following annotations will be patched into the Service: - 'monitor.kubeblocks.io/path' - 'monitor.kubeblocks.io/port' - 'monitor.kubeblocks.io/scheme' These annotations allow the Prometheus installed by KubeBlocks to discover and scrape metrics from the exporter.
- `name` (String) Specifies the Component's name. It's part of the Service DNS name and must comply with the IANA service naming rule. The name is optional when ClusterComponentSpec is used as a template (e.g., in 'shardingSpec'), but required otherwise. TODO +kubebuilder:validation:XValidation:rule='self == oldSelf',message='name is immutable'
- `offline_instances` (List of String) Specifies the names of instances to be transitioned to offline status. Marking an instance as offline results in the following: 1. The associated Pod is stopped, and its PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is retained for potential future reuse or data recovery, but it is no longer actively used. 2. The ordinal number assigned to this instance is preserved, ensuring it remains unique and avoiding conflicts with new instances. Setting instances to offline allows for a controlled scale-in process, preserving their data and maintaining ordinal consistency within the Cluster. Note that offline instances and their associated resources, such as PVCs, are not automatically deleted. The administrator must manually manage the cleanup and removal of these resources when they are no longer needed.
- `parallel_pod_management_concurrency` (String) Controls the concurrency of pods during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. It only used when 'PodManagementPolicy' is set to 'Parallel'. The default Concurrency is 100%.
- `pod_update_policy` (String) PodUpdatePolicy indicates how pods should be updated - 'StrictInPlace' indicates that only allows in-place upgrades. Any attempt to modify other fields will be rejected. - 'PreferInPlace' indicates that we will first attempt an in-place upgrade of the Pod. If that fails, it will fall back to the ReCreate, where pod will be recreated. Default value is 'PreferInPlace'
- `resources` (Attributes) Specifies the resources required by the Component. It allows defining the CPU, memory requirements and limits for the Component's containers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--resources))
- `scheduling_policy` (Attributes) Specifies the scheduling policy for the Component. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--scheduling_policy))
- `service_account_name` (String) Specifies the name of the ServiceAccount required by the running Component. This ServiceAccount is used to grant necessary permissions for the Component's Pods to interact with other Kubernetes resources, such as modifying Pod labels or sending events. Defaults: To perform certain operational tasks, agent sidecars running in Pods require specific RBAC permissions. The service account will be bound to a default role named 'kubeblocks-cluster-pod-role' which is installed together with KubeBlocks. If not specified, KubeBlocks automatically assigns a default ServiceAccount named 'kb-{cluster.name}' Future Changes: Future versions might change the default ServiceAccount creation strategy to one per Component, potentially revising the naming to 'kb-{cluster.name}-{component.name}'. Users can override the automatic ServiceAccount assignment by explicitly setting the name of an existed ServiceAccount in this field.
- `service_refs` (Attributes List) Defines a list of ServiceRef for a Component, enabling access to both external services and Services provided by other Clusters. Types of services: - External services: Not managed by KubeBlocks or managed by a different KubeBlocks operator; Require a ServiceDescriptor for connection details. - Services provided by a Cluster: Managed by the same KubeBlocks operator; identified using Cluster, Component and Service names. ServiceRefs with identical 'serviceRef.name' in the same Cluster are considered the same. Example: '''yaml serviceRefs: - name: 'redis-sentinel' serviceDescriptor: name: 'external-redis-sentinel' - name: 'postgres-cluster' clusterServiceSelector: cluster: 'my-postgres-cluster' service: component: 'postgresql' ''' The example above includes ServiceRefs to an external Redis Sentinel service and a PostgreSQL Cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--service_refs))
- `service_version` (String) ServiceVersion specifies the version of the Service expected to be provisioned by this Component. The version should follow the syntax and semantics of the 'Semantic Versioning' specification (http://semver.org/). If no version is specified, the latest available version will be used.
- `services` (Attributes List) Overrides services defined in referenced ComponentDefinition and expose endpoints that can be accessed by clients. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--services))
- `stop` (Boolean) Stop the Component. If set, all the computing resources will be released.
- `switch_policy` (Attributes) Defines the strategy for switchover and failover. Deprecated since v0.9. This field is maintained for backward compatibility and its use is discouraged. Existing usage should be updated to the current preferred approach to avoid compatibility issues in future releases. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--switch_policy))
- `system_accounts` (Attributes List) Overrides system accounts defined in referenced ComponentDefinition. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--system_accounts))
- `tls` (Boolean) A boolean flag that indicates whether the Component should use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for secure communication. When set to true, the Component will be configured to use TLS encryption for its network connections. This ensures that the data transmitted between the Component and its clients or other Components is encrypted and protected from unauthorized access. If TLS is enabled, the Component may require additional configuration, such as specifying TLS certificates and keys, to properly set up the secure communication channel.
- `tolerations` (Map of String) Allows Pods to be scheduled onto nodes with matching taints. Each toleration in the array allows the Pod to tolerate node taints based on specified 'key', 'value', 'effect', and 'operator'. - The 'key', 'value', and 'effect' identify the taint that the toleration matches. - The 'operator' determines how the toleration matches the taint. Pods with matching tolerations are allowed to be scheduled on tainted nodes, typically reserved for specific purposes. Deprecated since v0.10, replaced by the 'schedulingPolicy' field.
- `update_strategy` (String) Defines the update strategy for the Component. Deprecated since v0.9. This field is maintained for backward compatibility and its use is discouraged. Existing usage should be updated to the current preferred approach to avoid compatibility issues in future releases.
- `user_resource_refs` (Attributes) Allows users to specify custom ConfigMaps and Secrets to be mounted as volumes in the Cluster's Pods. This is useful in scenarios where users need to provide additional resources to the Cluster, such as: - Mounting custom scripts or configuration files during Cluster startup. - Mounting Secrets as volumes to provide sensitive information, like S3 AK/SK, to the Cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--user_resource_refs))
- `volume_claim_templates` (Attributes List) Specifies a list of PersistentVolumeClaim templates that represent the storage requirements for the Component. Each template specifies the desired characteristics of a persistent volume, such as storage class, size, and access modes. These templates are used to dynamically provision persistent volumes for the Component. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--volume_claim_templates))
- `volumes` (Attributes List) List of volumes to override. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--volumes))

Required:

- `class` (String) Defines the name of the class that is defined in the ComponentClassDefinition.

Optional:

- `name` (String) Specifies the name of the ComponentClassDefinition.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--component_specs--configs"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.component_specs.configs`

Optional:

- `config_map` (Attributes) ConfigMap source for the config. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--configs--config_map))
- `name` (String) The name of the config.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--component_specs--configs--config_map"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.component_specs.configs.config_map`

Optional:

- `default_mode` (Number) defaultMode is optional: mode bits used to set permissions on created files by default. Must be an octal value between 0000 and 0777 or a decimal value between 0 and 511. YAML accepts both octal and decimal values, JSON requires decimal values for mode bits. Defaults to 0644. Directories within the path are not affected by this setting. This might be in conflict with other options that affect the file mode, like fsGroup, and the result can be other mode bits set.
- `items` (Attributes List) items if unspecified, each key-value pair in the Data field of the referenced ConfigMap will be projected into the volume as a file whose name is the key and content is the value. If specified, the listed keys will be projected into the specified paths, and unlisted keys will not be present.

### Nested Schema for `spec.component_specs.instances.scheduling_policy.tolerations`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

### Nested Schema for `spec.component_specs.instances.scheduling_policy.topology_spread_constraints`

Required:

- `max_skew` (Number) MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule', it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P | P P | P | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway', it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
- `topology_key` (String) TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a 'bucket', and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is 'kubernetes.io/hostname', each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey is 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', each zone is a domain of that topology. It's a required field.
- `when_unsatisfiable` (String) WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location, but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the skew. A constraint is considered 'Unsatisfiable' for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate 'MaxSkew' on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P | P | P | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

Optional:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--instances--scheduling_policy--topology_spread_constraints--label_selector))
- `match_label_keys` (List of String) MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector. MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector. This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `min_domains` (Number) MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread treats 'global minimum' as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P | P P | P P | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so 'global minimum' is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew. This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `node_affinity_policy` (String) NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations. - Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations. If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
- `node_taints_policy` (String) NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included. - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included. If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

The default is nil which means that the limit is undefined. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#emptydir


<a id="nestedatt--spec--component_specs--instances--volumes--ephemeral"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.component_specs.instances.volumes.ephemeral`

Optional:

- `volume_claim_template` (Attributes) Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume. The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the pod. The name of the PVC will be '<pod name>-<volume name>' where '<volume name>' is the name from the 'PodSpec.Volumes' array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long). An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster. This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes to the PVC after it has been created. Required, must not be nil. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--component_specs--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.component_specs.instances.volumes.ephemeral.volume_claim_template`

Required:

- `spec` (Attributes) The specification for the PersistentVolumeClaim. The entire content is copied unchanged into the PVC that gets created from this template. The same fields as in a PersistentVolumeClaim are also valid here. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec))

Optional:

- `metadata` (Attributes) May contain labels and annotations that will be copied into the PVC when creating it. No other fields are allowed and will be rejected during validation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--metadata))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--component_specs--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.component_specs.instances.volumes.ephemeral.volume_claim_template.spec`

Optional:

- `access_modes` (List of String) accessModes contains the desired access modes the volume should have. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1
- `data_source` (Attributes) dataSource field can be used to specify either: * An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot) * An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source, it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source. When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef, and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified. If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source))
- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty. There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified. * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source_ref))
- `resources` (Attributes) resources represents the minimum resources the volume should have.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#resources (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--resources))
- `selector` (Attributes) selector is a label query over volumes to consider for binding. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--selector))
- `storage_class_name` (String) storageClassName is the name of the StorageClass required by the claim. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1
- `volume_attributes_class_name` (String) volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim. If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes defined in the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName, it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set. If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists. If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource exists. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#volumeattributesclass (Alpha) Using this field requires the VolumeAttributesClass feature gate to be enabled.
- `volume_mode` (String) volumeMode defines what type of volume is required by the claim. Value of Filesystem is implied when not included in claim spec.
- `volume_name` (String) volumeName is the binding reference to the PersistentVolume backing this claim.

### Nested Schema for `spec.component_specs.scheduling_policy.tolerations`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

### Nested Schema for `spec.component_specs.scheduling_policy.topology_spread_constraints`

Required:

- `max_skew` (Number) MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule', it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P | P P | P | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway', it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
- `topology_key` (String) TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a 'bucket', and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is 'kubernetes.io/hostname', each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey is 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', each zone is a domain of that topology. It's a required field.
- `when_unsatisfiable` (String) WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location, but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the skew. A constraint is considered 'Unsatisfiable' for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate 'MaxSkew' on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P | P | P | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

Optional:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--scheduling_policy--topology_spread_constraints--label_selector))
- `match_label_keys` (List of String) MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector. MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector. This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `min_domains` (Number) MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread treats 'global minimum' as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P | P P | P P | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so 'global minimum' is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew. This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `node_affinity_policy` (String) NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations. - Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations. If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
- `node_taints_policy` (String) NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included. - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included. If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

The maximum usage on memory medium EmptyDir would be the minimum value between the SizeLimit specified here and the sum of memory limits of all containers in a pod. The default is nil which means that the limit is undefined. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#emptydir


<a id="nestedatt--spec--component_specs--volumes--ephemeral"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.component_specs.volumes.ephemeral`

Optional:

- `volume_claim_template` (Attributes) Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume. The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the pod. The name of the PVC will be '<pod name>-<volume name>' where '<volume name>' is the name from the 'PodSpec.Volumes' array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long). An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster. This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes to the PVC after it has been created. Required, must not be nil. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template))

Optional:

- `metadata` (Attributes) May contain labels and annotations that will be copied into the PVC when creating it. No other fields are allowed and will be rejected during validation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--metadata))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--component_specs--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.component_specs.volumes.ephemeral.volume_claim_template.spec`

Optional:

- `access_modes` (List of String) accessModes contains the desired access modes the volume should have. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1
- `data_source` (Attributes) dataSource field can be used to specify either: * An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot) * An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source, it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source. When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef, and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified. If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source))
- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty. There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified. * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source_ref))
- `resources` (Attributes) resources represents the minimum resources the volume should have. If RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature is enabled users are allowed to specify resource requirements that are lower than previous value but must still be higher than capacity recorded in the status field of the claim. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#resources (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--resources))
- `selector` (Attributes) selector is a label query over volumes to consider for binding. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--component_specs--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--selector))
- `storage_class_name` (String) storageClassName is the name of the StorageClass required by the claim. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1
- `volume_attributes_class_name` (String) volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim. If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes defined in the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName, it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set. If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists. If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource exists. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#volumeattributesclass (Alpha) Using this field requires the VolumeAttributesClass feature gate to be enabled.
- `volume_mode` (String) volumeMode defines what type of volume is required by the claim. Value of Filesystem is implied when not included in claim spec.
- `volume_name` (String) volumeName is the binding reference to the PersistentVolume backing this claim.

Required:

- `topology_key` (String) This pod should be co-located (affinity) or not co-located (anti-affinity) with the pods matching the labelSelector in the specified namespaces, where co-located is defined as running on a node whose value of the label with key topologyKey matches that of any node on which any of the selected pods is running. Empty topologyKey is not allowed.

Optional:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) A label query over a set of resources, in this case pods. If it's null, this PodAffinityTerm matches with no Pods. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--scheduling_policy--affinity--pod_anti_affinity--required_during_scheduling_ignored_during_execution--label_selector))
- `match_label_keys` (List of String) MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with 'LabelSelector' as 'key in (value)' to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector. Also, MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set. This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.
- `mismatch_label_keys` (List of String) MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with 'LabelSelector' as 'key notin (value)' to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--scheduling_policy--tolerations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.scheduling_policy.tolerations`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
- `value` (String) Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--scheduling_policy--topology_spread_constraints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.scheduling_policy.topology_spread_constraints`

Required:

- `max_skew` (Number) MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule', it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P | P P | P | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway', it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
- `topology_key` (String) TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a 'bucket', and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is 'kubernetes.io/hostname', each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey is 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', each zone is a domain of that topology. It's a required field.
- `when_unsatisfiable` (String) WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location, but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the skew. A constraint is considered 'Unsatisfiable' for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate 'MaxSkew' on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P | P | P | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

Optional:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--scheduling_policy--topology_spread_constraints--label_selector))
- `match_label_keys` (List of String) MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector. MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector. This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `min_domains` (Number) MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread treats 'global minimum' as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P | P P | P P | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so 'global minimum' is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew. This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `node_affinity_policy` (String) NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations. - Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations. If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
- `node_taints_policy` (String) NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included. - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included. If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

### Nested Schema for `spec.scheduling_policy.topology_spread_constraints.label_selector.match_expressions`

Required:

- `key` (String) key is the label key that the selector applies to.
- `operator` (String) operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

Optional:

- `values` (List of String) values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.





<a id="nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.sharding_specs`

Required:

- `name` (String) Represents the common parent part of all shard names. This identifier is included as part of the Service DNS name and must comply with IANA service naming rules. It is used to generate the names of underlying Components following the pattern '$(shardingSpec.name)-$(ShardID)'. ShardID is a random string that is appended to the Name to generate unique identifiers for each shard. For example, if the sharding specification name is 'my-shard' and the ShardID is 'abc', the resulting Component name would be 'my-shard-abc'. Note that the name defined in Component template('shardingSpec.template.name') will be disregarded when generating the Component names of the shards. The 'shardingSpec.name' field takes precedence.
- `template` (Attributes) The template for generating Components for shards, where each shard consists of one Component. This field is of type ClusterComponentSpec, which encapsulates all the required details and definitions for creating and managing the Components. KubeBlocks uses this template to generate a set of identical Components or shards. All the generated Components will have the same specifications and definitions as specified in the 'template' field. This allows for the creation of multiple Components with consistent configurations, enabling sharding and distribution of workloads across Components. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template))

Optional:

- `shards` (Number) Specifies the desired number of shards. Users can declare the desired number of shards through this field. KubeBlocks dynamically creates and deletes Components based on the difference between the desired and actual number of shards. KubeBlocks provides lifecycle management for sharding, including: - Executing the postProvision Action defined in the ComponentDefinition when the number of shards increases. This allows for custom actions to be performed after a new shard is provisioned. - Executing the preTerminate Action defined in the ComponentDefinition when the number of shards decreases. This enables custom cleanup or data migration tasks to be executed before a shard is terminated. Resources and data associated with the corresponding Component will also be deleted.

### Nested Schema for `spec.sharding_specs.template`

Required:

- `replicas` (Number) Specifies the desired number of replicas in the Component for enhancing availability and durability, or load balancing.

Optional:

- `affinity` (Attributes) Specifies a group of affinity scheduling rules for the Component. It allows users to control how the Component's Pods are scheduled onto nodes in the K8s cluster. Deprecated since v0.10, replaced by the 'schedulingPolicy' field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--affinity))
- `annotations` (Map of String) Specifies Annotations to override or add for underlying Pods, PVCs, Account & TLS Secrets, Services Owned by Component.
- `class_def_ref` (Attributes) References the class defined in ComponentClassDefinition. Deprecated since v0.9. This field is maintained for backward compatibility and its use is discouraged. Existing usage should be updated to the current preferred approach to avoid compatibility issues in future releases. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--class_def_ref))
- `component_def` (String) Specifies the exact name, name prefix, or regular expression pattern for matching the name of the ComponentDefinition custom resource (CR) that defines the Component's characteristics and behavior. If both 'componentDefRef' and 'componentDef' are provided, the 'componentDef' will take precedence over 'componentDefRef'.
- `component_def_ref` (String) References a ClusterComponentDefinition defined in the 'clusterDefinition.spec.componentDef' field. Must comply with the IANA service naming rule. Deprecated since v0.9, because defining Components in 'clusterDefinition.spec.componentDef' field has been deprecated. This field is replaced by the 'componentDef' field, use 'componentDef' instead. This field is maintained for backward compatibility and its use is discouraged. Existing usage should be updated to the current preferred approach to avoid compatibility issues in future releases. TODO +kubebuilder:validation:XValidation:rule='self == oldSelf',message='componentDefRef is immutable'
- `configs` (Attributes List) Specifies the configuration content of a config template. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--configs))
- `disable_exporter` (Boolean) Determines whether metrics exporter information is annotated on the Component's headless Service. If set to true, the following annotations will not be patched into the Service: - 'monitor.kubeblocks.io/path' - 'monitor.kubeblocks.io/port' - 'monitor.kubeblocks.io/scheme' These annotations allow the Prometheus installed by KubeBlocks to discover and scrape metrics from the exporter.
- `enabled_logs` (List of String) Specifies which types of logs should be collected for the Component. The log types are defined in the 'componentDefinition.spec.logConfigs' field with the LogConfig entries. The elements in the 'enabledLogs' array correspond to the names of the LogConfig entries. For example, if the 'componentDefinition.spec.logConfigs' defines LogConfig entries with names 'slow_query_log' and 'error_log', you can enable the collection of these logs by including their names in the 'enabledLogs' array: '''yaml enabledLogs: - slow_query_log - error_log '''
- `env` (Attributes List) List of environment variables to add. These environment variables will be placed after the environment variables declared in the Pod. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--env))
- `instance_update_strategy` (Attributes) Indicates the InstanceUpdateStrategy that will be employed to update Pods in the InstanceSet when a revision is made to Template. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--instance_update_strategy))
- `instances` (Attributes List) Allows for the customization of configuration values for each instance within a Component. An instance represent a single replica (Pod and associated K8s resources like PVCs, Services, and ConfigMaps). While instances typically share a common configuration as defined in the ClusterComponentSpec, they can require unique settings in various scenarios: For example: - A database Component might require different resource allocations for primary and secondary instances, with primaries needing more resources. - During a rolling upgrade, a Component may first update the image for one or a few instances, and then update the remaining instances after verifying that the updated instances are functioning correctly. InstanceTemplate allows for specifying these unique configurations per instance. Each instance's name is constructed using the pattern: $(component.name)-$(template.name)-$(ordinal), starting with an ordinal of 0. It is crucial to maintain unique names for each InstanceTemplate to avoid conflicts. The sum of replicas across all InstanceTemplates should not exceed the total number of replicas specified for the Component. Any remaining replicas will be generated using the default template and will follow the default naming rules. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--instances))
- `issuer` (Attributes) Specifies the configuration for the TLS certificates issuer. It allows defining the issuer name and the reference to the secret containing the TLS certificates and key. The secret should contain the CA certificate, TLS certificate, and private key in the specified keys. Required when TLS is enabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--issuer))
- `labels` (Map of String) Specifies Labels to override or add for underlying Pods, PVCs, Account & TLS Secrets, Services Owned by Component.
- `monitor` (Boolean) Deprecated since v0.9 Determines whether metrics exporter information is annotated on the Component's headless Service. If set to true, the following annotations will be patched into the Service: - 'monitor.kubeblocks.io/path' - 'monitor.kubeblocks.io/port' - 'monitor.kubeblocks.io/scheme' These annotations allow the Prometheus installed by KubeBlocks to discover and scrape metrics from the exporter.
- `name` (String) Specifies the Component's name. It's part of the Service DNS name and must comply with the IANA service naming rule. The name is optional when ClusterComponentSpec is used as a template (e.g., in 'shardingSpec'), but required otherwise. TODO +kubebuilder:validation:XValidation:rule='self == oldSelf',message='name is immutable'
- `offline_instances` (List of String) Specifies the names of instances to be transitioned to offline status. Marking an instance as offline results in the following: 1. The associated Pod is stopped, and its PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is retained for potential future reuse or data recovery, but it is no longer actively used. 2. The ordinal number assigned to this instance is preserved, ensuring it remains unique and avoiding conflicts with new instances. Setting instances to offline allows for a controlled scale-in process, preserving their data and maintaining ordinal consistency within the Cluster. Note that offline instances and their associated resources, such as PVCs, are not automatically deleted. The administrator must manually manage the cleanup and removal of these resources when they are no longer needed.
- `parallel_pod_management_concurrency` (String) Controls the concurrency of pods during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. It only used when 'PodManagementPolicy' is set to 'Parallel'. The default Concurrency is 100%.
- `pod_update_policy` (String) PodUpdatePolicy indicates how pods should be updated - 'StrictInPlace' indicates that only allows in-place upgrades. Any attempt to modify other fields will be rejected. - 'PreferInPlace' indicates that we will first attempt an in-place upgrade of the Pod. If that fails, it will fall back to the ReCreate, where pod will be recreated. Default value is 'PreferInPlace'
- `resources` (Attributes) Specifies the resources required by the Component. It allows defining the CPU, memory requirements and limits for the Component's containers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--resources))
- `scheduling_policy` (Attributes) Specifies the scheduling policy for the Component. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--scheduling_policy))
- `service_account_name` (String) Specifies the name of the ServiceAccount required by the running Component. This ServiceAccount is used to grant necessary permissions for the Component's Pods to interact with other Kubernetes resources, such as modifying Pod labels or sending events. Defaults: To perform certain operational tasks, agent sidecars running in Pods require specific RBAC permissions. The service account will be bound to a default role named 'kubeblocks-cluster-pod-role' which is installed together with KubeBlocks. If not specified, KubeBlocks automatically assigns a default ServiceAccount named 'kb-{cluster.name}' Future Changes: Future versions might change the default ServiceAccount creation strategy to one per Component, potentially revising the naming to 'kb-{cluster.name}-{component.name}'. Users can override the automatic ServiceAccount assignment by explicitly setting the name of an existed ServiceAccount in this field.
- `service_refs` (Attributes List) Defines a list of ServiceRef for a Component, enabling access to both external services and Services provided by other Clusters. Types of services: - External services: Not managed by KubeBlocks or managed by a different KubeBlocks operator; Require a ServiceDescriptor for connection details. - Services provided by a Cluster: Managed by the same KubeBlocks operator; identified using Cluster, Component and Service names. ServiceRefs with identical 'serviceRef.name' in the same Cluster are considered the same. Example: '''yaml serviceRefs: - name: 'redis-sentinel' serviceDescriptor: name: 'external-redis-sentinel' - name: 'postgres-cluster' clusterServiceSelector: cluster: 'my-postgres-cluster' service: component: 'postgresql' ''' The example above includes ServiceRefs to an external Redis Sentinel service and a PostgreSQL Cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--service_refs))
- `service_version` (String) ServiceVersion specifies the version of the Service expected to be provisioned by this Component. The version should follow the syntax and semantics of the 'Semantic Versioning' specification (http://semver.org/). If no version is specified, the latest available version will be used.
- `services` (Attributes List) Overrides services defined in referenced ComponentDefinition and expose endpoints that can be accessed by clients. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--services))
- `stop` (Boolean) Stop the Component. If set, all the computing resources will be released.
- `switch_policy` (Attributes) Defines the strategy for switchover and failover. Deprecated since v0.9. This field is maintained for backward compatibility and its use is discouraged. Existing usage should be updated to the current preferred approach to avoid compatibility issues in future releases. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--switch_policy))
- `system_accounts` (Attributes List) Overrides system accounts defined in referenced ComponentDefinition. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--system_accounts))
- `tls` (Boolean) A boolean flag that indicates whether the Component should use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for secure communication. When set to true, the Component will be configured to use TLS encryption for its network connections. This ensures that the data transmitted between the Component and its clients or other Components is encrypted and protected from unauthorized access. If TLS is enabled, the Component may require additional configuration, such as specifying TLS certificates and keys, to properly set up the secure communication channel.
- `tolerations` (Map of String) Allows Pods to be scheduled onto nodes with matching taints. Each toleration in the array allows the Pod to tolerate node taints based on specified 'key', 'value', 'effect', and 'operator'. - The 'key', 'value', and 'effect' identify the taint that the toleration matches. - The 'operator' determines how the toleration matches the taint. Pods with matching tolerations are allowed to be scheduled on tainted nodes, typically reserved for specific purposes. Deprecated since v0.10, replaced by the 'schedulingPolicy' field.
- `update_strategy` (String) Defines the update strategy for the Component. Deprecated since v0.9. This field is maintained for backward compatibility and its use is discouraged. Existing usage should be updated to the current preferred approach to avoid compatibility issues in future releases.
- `user_resource_refs` (Attributes) Allows users to specify custom ConfigMaps and Secrets to be mounted as volumes in the Cluster's Pods. This is useful in scenarios where users need to provide additional resources to the Cluster, such as: - Mounting custom scripts or configuration files during Cluster startup. - Mounting Secrets as volumes to provide sensitive information, like S3 AK/SK, to the Cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--user_resource_refs))
- `volume_claim_templates` (Attributes List) Specifies a list of PersistentVolumeClaim templates that represent the storage requirements for the Component. Each template specifies the desired characteristics of a persistent volume, such as storage class, size, and access modes. These templates are used to dynamically provision persistent volumes for the Component. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--volume_claim_templates))
- `volumes` (Attributes List) List of volumes to override. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--volumes))

### Nested Schema for `spec.sharding_specs.template.affinity`

Optional:

- `node_labels` (Map of String) Indicates the node labels that must be present on nodes for pods to be scheduled on them. It is a map where the keys are the label keys and the values are the corresponding label values. Pods will only be scheduled on nodes that have all the specified labels with the corresponding values. For example, if NodeLabels is set to {'nodeType': 'ssd', 'environment': 'production'}, pods will only be scheduled on nodes that have both the 'nodeType' label with value 'ssd' and the 'environment' label with value 'production'. This field allows users to control Pod placement based on specific node labels. It can be used to ensure that Pods are scheduled on nodes with certain characteristics, such as specific hardware (e.g., SSD), environment (e.g., production, staging), or any other custom labels assigned to nodes.
- `pod_anti_affinity` (String) Specifies the anti-affinity level of Pods within a Component. It determines how pods should be spread across nodes to improve availability and performance. It can have the following values: 'Preferred' and 'Required'. The default value is 'Preferred'.
- `tenancy` (String) Determines the level of resource isolation between Pods. It can have the following values: 'SharedNode' and 'DedicatedNode'. - SharedNode: Allow that multiple Pods may share the same node, which is the default behavior of K8s. - DedicatedNode: Each Pod runs on a dedicated node, ensuring that no two Pods share the same node. In other words, if a Pod is already running on a node, no other Pods will be scheduled on that node. Which provides a higher level of isolation and resource guarantee for Pods. The default value is 'SharedNode'.
- `topology_keys` (List of String) Represents the key of node labels used to define the topology domain for Pod anti-affinity and Pod spread constraints. In K8s, a topology domain is a set of nodes that have the same value for a specific label key. Nodes with labels containing any of the specified TopologyKeys and identical values are considered to be in the same topology domain. Note: The concept of topology in the context of K8s TopologyKeys is different from the concept of topology in the ClusterDefinition. When a Pod has anti-affinity or spread constraints specified, Kubernetes will attempt to schedule the Pod on nodes with different values for the specified TopologyKeys. This ensures that Pods are spread across different topology domains, promoting high availability and reducing the impact of node failures. Some well-known label keys, such as 'kubernetes.io/hostname' and 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', are often used as TopologyKey. These keys represent the hostname and zone of a node, respectively. By including these keys in the TopologyKeys list, Pods will be spread across nodes with different hostnames or zones. In addition to the well-known keys, users can also specify custom label keys as TopologyKeys. This allows for more flexible and custom topology definitions based on the specific needs of the application or environment. The TopologyKeys field is a slice of strings, where each string represents a label key. The order of the keys in the slice does not matter.

### Nested Schema for `spec.sharding_specs.template.instances.scheduling_policy.affinity.pod_anti_affinity.required_during_scheduling_ignored_during_execution.namespace_selector.match_expressions`

Required:

- `key` (String) key is the label key that the selector applies to.
- `operator` (String) operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

Optional:

- `values` (List of String) values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.






<a id="nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--instances--scheduling_policy--tolerations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.sharding_specs.template.instances.scheduling_policy.tolerations`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
- `value` (String) Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--instances--scheduling_policy--topology_spread_constraints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.sharding_specs.template.instances.scheduling_policy.topology_spread_constraints`

Required:

- `max_skew` (Number) MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule', it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P | P P | P | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway', it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
- `topology_key` (String) TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a 'bucket', and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is 'kubernetes.io/hostname', each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey is 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', each zone is a domain of that topology. It's a required field.
- `when_unsatisfiable` (String) WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location, but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the skew. A constraint is considered 'Unsatisfiable' for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate 'MaxSkew' on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P | P | P | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

Optional:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--instances--scheduling_policy--topology_spread_constraints--label_selector))
- `match_label_keys` (List of String) MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector. MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector. This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `min_domains` (Number) MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread treats 'global minimum' as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P | P P | P P | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so 'global minimum' is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew. This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `node_affinity_policy` (String) NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations. - Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations. If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
- `node_taints_policy` (String) NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included. - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included. If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--instances--volumes--ephemeral"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.sharding_specs.template.instances.volumes.ephemeral`

Optional:

- `volume_claim_template` (Attributes) Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume. The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the pod. The name of the PVC will be '<pod name>-<volume name>' where '<volume name>' is the name from the 'PodSpec.Volumes' array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long). An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster. This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes to the PVC after it has been created. Required, must not be nil. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template))

Optional:

- `metadata` (Attributes) May contain labels and annotations that will be copied into the PVC when creating it. No other fields are allowed and will be rejected during validation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--metadata))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.sharding_specs.template.instances.volumes.ephemeral.volume_claim_template.spec`

Optional:

- `access_modes` (List of String) accessModes contains the desired access modes the volume should have. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1
- `data_source` (Attributes) dataSource field can be used to specify either: * An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot) * An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source, it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source. When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef, and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified. If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source))
- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty. There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified. * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source_ref))
- `resources` (Attributes) resources represents the minimum resources the volume should have.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#resources (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--resources))
- `selector` (Attributes) selector is a label query over volumes to consider for binding. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--selector))
- `storage_class_name` (String) storageClassName is the name of the StorageClass required by the claim. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1
- `volume_attributes_class_name` (String) volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim. If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes defined in the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName, it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set. If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists. If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource exists. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#volumeattributesclass (Alpha) Using this field requires the VolumeAttributesClass feature gate to be enabled.
- `volume_mode` (String) volumeMode defines what type of volume is required by the claim. Value of Filesystem is implied when not included in claim spec.
- `volume_name` (String) volumeName is the binding reference to the PersistentVolume backing this claim.

### Nested Schema for `spec.sharding_specs.template.scheduling_policy.affinity.pod_anti_affinity.required_during_scheduling_ignored_during_execution`

Required:

- `topology_key` (String) This pod should be co-located (affinity) or not co-located (anti-affinity) with the pods matching the labelSelector in the specified namespaces, where co-located is defined as running on a node whose value of the label with key topologyKey matches that of any node on which any of the selected pods is running. Empty topologyKey is not allowed.

Optional:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) A label query over a set of resources, in this case pods. If it's null, this PodAffinityTerm matches with no Pods. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--scheduling_policy--affinity--pod_anti_affinity--required_during_scheduling_ignored_during_execution--label_selector))
- `match_label_keys` (List of String) MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with 'LabelSelector' as 'key in (value)' to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector. Also, MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set. This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.
- `mismatch_label_keys` (List of String) MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with 'LabelSelector' as 'key notin (value)' to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector. Also, MismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set. This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.
- `namespace_selector` (Attributes) A label query over the set of namespaces that the term applies to. The term is applied to the union of the namespaces selected by this field and the ones listed in the namespaces field. null selector and null or empty namespaces list means 'this pod's namespace'. An empty selector ({}) matches all namespaces. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--scheduling_policy--affinity--pod_anti_affinity--required_during_scheduling_ignored_during_execution--namespace_selector))
- `namespaces` (List of String) namespaces specifies a static list of namespace names that the term applies to. The term is applied to the union of the namespaces listed in this field and the ones selected by namespaceSelector. null or empty namespaces list and null namespaceSelector means 'this pod's namespace'.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--scheduling_policy--tolerations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.sharding_specs.template.scheduling_policy.tolerations`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
- `value` (String) Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--scheduling_policy--topology_spread_constraints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.sharding_specs.template.scheduling_policy.topology_spread_constraints`

Required:

- `max_skew` (Number) MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule', it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P | P P | P | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway', it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
- `topology_key` (String) TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a 'bucket', and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is 'kubernetes.io/hostname', each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey is 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', each zone is a domain of that topology. It's a required field.
- `when_unsatisfiable` (String) WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location, but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the skew. A constraint is considered 'Unsatisfiable' for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate 'MaxSkew' on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P | P | P | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

Optional:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--scheduling_policy--topology_spread_constraints--label_selector))
- `match_label_keys` (List of String) MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector. MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector. This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `min_domains` (Number) MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread treats 'global minimum' as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P | P P | P P | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so 'global minimum' is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew. This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `node_affinity_policy` (String) NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations. - Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations. If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
- `node_taints_policy` (String) NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included. - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included. If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--volumes--ephemeral"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.sharding_specs.template.volumes.ephemeral`

Optional:

- `volume_claim_template` (Attributes) Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume. The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the pod. The name of the PVC will be '<pod name>-<volume name>' where '<volume name>' is the name from the 'PodSpec.Volumes' array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long). An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster. This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes to the PVC after it has been created. Required, must not be nil. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template))

The same fields as in a PersistentVolumeClaim are also valid here. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec))

Optional:

- `metadata` (Attributes) May contain labels and annotations that will be copied into the PVC when creating it. No other fields are allowed and will be rejected during validation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--metadata))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.sharding_specs.template.volumes.ephemeral.volume_claim_template.spec`

Optional:

- `access_modes` (List of String) accessModes contains the desired access modes the volume should have. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1
- `data_source` (Attributes) dataSource field can be used to specify either: * An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot) * An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source, it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source. When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef, and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified. If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source))
- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty. There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified. * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--sharding_specs--template--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source_ref))
- `resources` (Attributes) resources represents the minimum resources the volume should have.

An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set. If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists. If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource exists. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#volumeattributesclass (Alpha) Using this field requires the VolumeAttributesClass feature gate to be enabled.
- `volume_mode` (String) volumeMode defines what type of volume is required by the claim. Value of Filesystem is implied when not included in claim spec.
