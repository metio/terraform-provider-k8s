NetworkPolicy describes what network traffic is allowed for a set of Pods

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_networking_k8s_io_network_policy_v1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) NetworkPolicySpec provides the specification of a NetworkPolicy (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `pod_selector` (Attributes) A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--pod_selector))

Optional:

- `egress` (Attributes List) egress is a list of egress rules to be applied to the selected pods. Outgoing traffic is allowed if there are no NetworkPolicies selecting the pod (and cluster policy otherwise allows the traffic), OR if the traffic matches at least one egress rule across all of the NetworkPolicy objects whose podSelector matches the pod. If this field is empty then this NetworkPolicy limits all outgoing traffic (and serves solely to ensure that the pods it selects are isolated by default). This field is beta-level in 1.8 (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress))
- `ingress` (Attributes List) ingress is a list of ingress rules to be applied to the selected pods. Traffic is allowed to a pod if there are no NetworkPolicies selecting the pod (and cluster policy otherwise allows the traffic), OR if the traffic source is the pod's local node, OR if the traffic matches at least one ingress rule across all of the NetworkPolicy objects whose podSelector matches the pod. If this field is empty then this NetworkPolicy does not allow any traffic (and serves solely to ensure that the pods it selects are isolated by default) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--ingress))
- `policy_types` (List of String) policyTypes is a list of rule types that the NetworkPolicy relates to. Valid options are ['Ingress'], ['Egress'], or ['Ingress', 'Egress']. If this field is not specified, it will default based on the existence of ingress or egress rules; policies that contain an egress section are assumed to affect egress, and all policies (whether or not they contain an ingress section) are assumed to affect ingress. If you want to write an egress-only policy, you must explicitly specify policyTypes [ 'Egress' ]. Likewise, if you want to write a policy that specifies that no egress is allowed, you must specify a policyTypes value that include 'Egress' (since such a policy would not include an egress section and would otherwise default to just [ 'Ingress' ]). This field is beta-level in 1.8

### Nested Schema for `spec.pod_selector`

Optional:

- `match_expressions` (Attributes List) matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--pod_selector--match_expressions))
- `match_labels` (Map of String) matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--pod_selector--match_expressions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.pod_selector.match_expressions`

Required:

- `key` (String) key is the label key that the selector applies to.
- `operator` (String) operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

Optional:

- `values` (List of String) values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.



<a id="nestedatt--spec--egress"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.egress`

Optional:

- `ports` (Attributes List) ports is a list of destination ports for outgoing traffic. Each item in this list is combined using a logical OR. If this field is empty or missing, this rule matches all ports (traffic not restricted by port). If this field is present and contains at least one item, then this rule allows traffic only if the traffic matches at least one port in the list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--ports))
- `to` (Attributes List) to is a list of destinations for outgoing traffic of pods selected for this rule. Items in this list are combined using a logical OR operation. If this field is empty or missing, this rule matches all destinations (traffic not restricted by destination). If this field is present and contains at least one item, this rule allows traffic only if the traffic matches at least one item in the to list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--to))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--egress--ports"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.egress.ports`

Optional:

- `end_port` (Number) endPort indicates that the range of ports from port to endPort if set, inclusive, should be allowed by the policy. This field cannot be defined if the port field is not defined or if the port field is defined as a named (string) port. The endPort must be equal or greater than port.
- `port` (String) IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string.  When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type.  This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.
- `protocol` (String) protocol represents the protocol (TCP, UDP, or SCTP) which traffic must match. If not specified, this field defaults to TCP.

The except entry describes CIDRs that should not be included within this rule. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--to--ip_block))
- `namespace_selector` (Attributes) A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects.

- `pod_selector` (Attributes) A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects.
