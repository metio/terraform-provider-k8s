# k8s_machineconfiguration_openshift_io_machine_config_pool_v1_manifest (Data Source)

MachineConfigPool describes a pool of MachineConfigs.  Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_machineconfiguration_openshift_io_machine_config_pool_v1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name = "some-name"

  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) MachineConfigPoolSpec is the spec for MachineConfigPool resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `configuration` (Attributes) The targeted MachineConfig object for the machine config pool. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--configuration))
- `machine_config_selector` (Attributes) machineConfigSelector specifies a label selector for MachineConfigs. Refer https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ on how label and selectors work. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--machine_config_selector))
- `max_unavailable` (String) maxUnavailable defines either an integer number or percentage of nodes in the pool that can go Unavailable during an update. This includes nodes Unavailable for any reason, including user initiated cordons, failing nodes, etc. The default value is 1.  A value larger than 1 will mean multiple nodes going unavailable during the update, which may affect your workload stress on the remaining nodes. You cannot set this value to 0 to stop updates (it will default back to 1); to stop updates, use the 'paused' property instead. Drain will respect Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) such as etcd quorum guards, even if maxUnavailable is greater than one.
- `node_selector` (Attributes) nodeSelector specifies a label selector for Machines (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--node_selector))
- `paused` (Boolean) paused specifies whether or not changes to this machine config pool should be stopped. This includes generating new desiredMachineConfig and update of machines.

### Nested Schema for `spec.configuration`

Optional:

- `api_version` (String) API version of the referent.
- `field_path` (String) If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: 'spec.containers{name}' (where 'name' refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified 'spec.containers[2]' (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future.
- `kind` (String) Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `name` (String) Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names
- `namespace` (String) Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/
- `resource_version` (String) Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
- `source` (Attributes List) source is the list of MachineConfig objects that were used to generate the single MachineConfig object specified in 'content'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--configuration--source))
- `uid` (String) UID of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids

### Nested Schema for `spec.machine_config_selector`

Optional:

- `match_expressions` (Attributes List) matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--machine_config_selector--match_expressions))
- `match_labels` (Map of String) matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.

### Nested Schema for `spec.machine_config_selector.match_expressions`

Required:

- `operator` (String) operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

Optional:

- `values` (List of String) values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.
