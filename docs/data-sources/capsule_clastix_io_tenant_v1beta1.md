### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) The API group of the requested resource.
- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.name`.
- `kind` (String) The type of the requested resource.
- `spec` (Attributes) TenantSpec defines the desired state of Tenant. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Read-Only:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Read-Only:

- `additional_role_bindings` (Attributes List) Specifies additional RoleBindings assigned to the Tenant. Capsule will ensure that all namespaces in the Tenant always contain the RoleBinding for the given ClusterRole. Optional. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--additional_role_bindings))
- `container_registries` (Attributes) Specifies the trusted Image Registries assigned to the Tenant. Capsule assures that all Pods resources created in the Tenant can use only one of the allowed trusted registries. Optional. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--container_registries))
- `image_pull_policies` (List of String) Specify the allowed values for the imagePullPolicies option in Pod resources. Capsule assures that all Pod resources created in the Tenant can use only one of the allowed policy. Optional.
- `ingress_options` (Attributes) Specifies options for the Ingress resources, such as allowed hostnames and IngressClass. Optional. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--ingress_options))

- `namespace_options` (Attributes) Specifies options for the Namespaces, such as additional metadata or maximum number of namespaces allowed for that Tenant. Once the namespace quota assigned to the Tenant has been reached, the Tenant owner cannot create further namespaces. Optional. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--namespace_options))
- `network_policies` (Attributes) Specifies the NetworkPolicies assigned to the Tenant. The assigned NetworkPolicies are inherited by any namespace created in the Tenant. Optional. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_policies))

The Capsule operator aggregates ResourceQuota at Tenant level, so that the hard quota is never crossed for the given Tenant. This permits the Tenant owner to consume resources in the Tenant regardless of the namespace. Optional. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--resource_quotas))
- `service_options` (Attributes) Specifies options for the Service, such as additional metadata or block of certain type of Services. Optional. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--service_options))

Read-Only:

<a id="nestedatt--spec--network_policies--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.network_policies.items`

Read-Only:

- `egress` (Attributes List) egress is a list of egress rules to be applied to the selected pods. Outgoing traffic is allowed if there are no NetworkPolicies selecting the pod (and cluster policy otherwise allows the traffic), OR if the traffic matches at least one egress rule across all of the NetworkPolicy objects whose podSelector matches the pod. If this field is empty then this NetworkPolicy limits all outgoing traffic (and serves solely to ensure that the pods it selects are isolated by default). This field is beta-level in 1.8 (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_policies--items--egress))
- `ingress` (Attributes List) ingress is a list of ingress rules to be applied to the selected pods. Traffic is allowed to a pod if there are no NetworkPolicies selecting the pod (and cluster policy otherwise allows the traffic), OR if the traffic source is the pod's local node, OR if the traffic matches at least one ingress rule across all of the NetworkPolicy objects whose podSelector matches the pod. If this field is empty then this NetworkPolicy does not allow any traffic (and serves solely to ensure that the pods it selects are isolated by default) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_policies--items--ingress))
- `pod_selector` (Attributes) podSelector selects the pods to which this NetworkPolicy object applies. The array of ingress rules is applied to any pods selected by this field. Multiple network policies can select the same set of pods. In this case, the ingress rules for each are combined additively. This field is NOT optional and follows standard label selector semantics. An empty podSelector matches all pods in this namespace. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_policies--items--pod_selector))
- `policy_types` (List of String) policyTypes is a list of rule types that the NetworkPolicy relates to. Valid options are ['Ingress'], ['Egress'], or ['Ingress', 'Egress']. If this field is not specified, it will default based on the existence of ingress or egress rules; policies that contain an egress section are assumed to affect egress, and all policies (whether or not they contain an ingress section) are assumed to affect ingress. If you want to write an egress-only policy, you must explicitly specify policyTypes [ 'Egress' ]. Likewise, if you want to write a policy that specifies that no egress is allowed, you must specify a policyTypes value that include 'Egress' (since such a policy would not include an egress section and would otherwise default to just [ 'Ingress' ]). This field is beta-level in 1.8

### Nested Schema for `spec.network_policies.items.policy_types`

(see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_policies--items--policy_types--ports))
- `to` (Attributes List) to is a list of destinations for outgoing traffic of pods selected for this rule. Items in this list are combined using a logical OR operation. If this field is empty or missing, this rule matches all destinations (traffic not restricted by destination).

- `port` (String) port represents the port on the given protocol. This can either be a numerical or named port on a pod. If this field is not provided, this matches all port names and numbers. If present, only traffic on the specified protocol AND port will be matched.

This field follows standard label selector semantics; if present but empty, it selects all namespaces.  If podSelector is also set, then the NetworkPolicyPeer as a whole selects the pods matching podSelector in the namespaces selected by namespaceSelector. Otherwise it selects all pods in the namespaces selected by namespaceSelector. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_policies--items--policy_types--to--namespace_selector))
- `pod_selector` (Attributes) podSelector is a label selector which selects pods. This field follows standard label selector semantics; if present but empty, it selects all pods.  If namespaceSelector is also set, then the NetworkPolicyPeer as a whole selects the pods matching podSelector in the Namespaces selected by NamespaceSelector.
