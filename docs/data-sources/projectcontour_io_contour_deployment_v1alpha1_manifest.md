### Nested Schema for `spec.envoy.daemon_set.update_strategy.rolling_update`

Optional:

- `max_surge` (String) The maximum number of nodes with an existing available DaemonSet pod thatcan have an updated DaemonSet pod during during an update.Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.Default value is 0.Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodesthat should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updatedpod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet podon that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for anyreason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updatedpod is immediatedly created on that node without considering surge limits.Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by thedaemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, andso resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they maycause evictions during disruption.
- `max_unavailable` (String) The maximum number of DaemonSet pods that can be unavailable during theupdate. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of totalnumber of DaemonSet pods at the start of the update (ex: 10%). Absolutenumber is calculated from percentage by rounding up.This cannot be 0 if MaxSurge is 0Default value is 1.Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodesthat should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The updatestarts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then bringsup new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available,it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least70% of original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times duringthe update.

Optional:

- `volume_claim_template` (Attributes) Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be theowner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with thepod.  The name of the PVC will be '<pod name>-<volume name>' where'<volume name>' is the name from the 'PodSpec.Volumes' arrayentry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated nameis not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the podwill *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelatedvolume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked untilthe unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC ismeant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with anowner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normallythis should not be necessary, but it may be useful whenmanually reconstructing a broken cluster.This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetesto the PVC after it has been created.Required, must not be nil.

Optional:

- `metadata` (Map of String) May contain labels and annotations that will be copied into the PVCwhen creating it. No other fields are allowed and will be rejected duringvalidation.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--envoy--extra_volumes--vsphere_volume--volume_claim_template--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.envoy.extra_volumes.vsphere_volume.volume_claim_template.spec`

- `data_source` (Attributes) dataSource field can be used to specify either:* An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot)* An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--envoy--extra_volumes--vsphere_volume--volume_claim_template--metadata--data_source))
- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-emptyvolume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (noncore object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type ofthe specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamicprovisioner.This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as suchif both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwardscompatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the samevalue automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is  specified.* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects  in any namespaces.(Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.(Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

- `storage_class_name` (String) storageClassName is the name of the StorageClass required by the claim.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1
- `volume_attributes_class_name` (String) volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim.If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes definedin the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClasswill be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClasswill be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will beset to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resourceexists.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#volumeattributesclass(Alpha) Using this field requires the VolumeAttributesClass feature gate to be enabled.
- `volume_mode` (String) volumeMode defines what type of volume is required by the claim.Value of Filesystem is implied when not included in claim spec.
- `volume_name` (String) volumeName is the binding reference to the PersistentVolume backing this claim.
