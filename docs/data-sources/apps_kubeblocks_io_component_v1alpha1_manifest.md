- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `comp_def` (String) Specifies the name of the referenced ComponentDefinition.
- `replicas` (Number) Specifies the desired number of replicas in the Component for enhancing availability and durability, or load balancing.

Optional:

- `affinity` (Attributes) Specifies a group of affinity scheduling rules for the Component.It allows users to control how the Component's Pods are scheduled onto nodes in the Cluster.Deprecated since v0.10, replaced by the 'schedulingPolicy' field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--affinity))
- `annotations` (Map of String) Specifies Annotations to override or add for underlying Pods.
- `configs` (Attributes List) Specifies the configuration content of a config template. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--configs))
- `disable_exporter` (Boolean) Determines whether metrics exporter information is annotated on the Component's headless Service.If set to true, the following annotations will not be patched into the Service:- 'monitor.kubeblocks.io/path'- 'monitor.kubeblocks.io/port'- 'monitor.kubeblocks.io/scheme'These annotations allow the Prometheus installed by KubeBlocks to discover and scrape metrics from the exporter.
- `enabled_logs` (List of String) Specifies which types of logs should be collected for the Cluster.The log types are defined in the 'componentDefinition.spec.logConfigs' field with the LogConfig entries.The elements in the 'enabledLogs' array correspond to the names of the LogConfig entries.For example, if the 'componentDefinition.spec.logConfigs' defines LogConfig entries withnames 'slow_query_log' and 'error_log',you can enable the collection of these logs by including their names in the 'enabledLogs' array:'''yamlenabledLogs:- slow_query_log- error_log'''
- `env` (Attributes List) List of environment variables to add. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--env))
- `instances` (Attributes List) Allows for the customization of configuration values for each instance within a Component.An Instance represent a single replica (Pod and associated K8s resources like PVCs, Services, and ConfigMaps).While instances typically share a common configuration as defined in the ClusterComponentSpec,they can require unique settings in various scenarios:For example:- A database Component might require different resource allocations for primary and secondary instances,  with primaries needing more resources.- During a rolling upgrade, a Component may first update the image for one or a few instances,  and then update the remaining instances after verifying that the updated instances are functioning correctly.InstanceTemplate allows for specifying these unique configurations per instance.Each instance's name is constructed using the pattern: $(component.name)-$(template.name)-$(ordinal),starting with an ordinal of 0.It is crucial to maintain unique names for each InstanceTemplate to avoid conflicts.The sum of replicas across all InstanceTemplates should not exceed the total number of Replicas specified for the Component.Any remaining replicas will be generated using the default template and will follow the default naming rules. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--instances))
- `labels` (Map of String) Specifies Labels to override or add for underlying Pods.
- `offline_instances` (List of String) Specifies the names of instances to be transitioned to offline status.Marking an instance as offline results in the following:1. The associated Pod is stopped, and its PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is retained for potential   future reuse or data recovery, but it is no longer actively used.2. The ordinal number assigned to this instance is preserved, ensuring it remains unique   and avoiding conflicts with new instances.Setting instances to offline allows for a controlled scale-in process, preserving their data and maintainingordinal consistency within the Cluster.Note that offline instances and their associated resources, such as PVCs, are not automatically deleted.The administrator must manually manage the cleanup and removal of these resources when they are no longer needed.
- `parallel_pod_management_concurrency` (String) Controls the concurrency of pods during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes,or when scaling down. It only used when 'PodManagementPolicy' is set to 'Parallel'.The default Concurrency is 100%.
- `pod_update_policy` (String) PodUpdatePolicy indicates how pods should be updated- 'StrictInPlace' indicates that only allows in-place upgrades.Any attempt to modify other fields will be rejected.- 'PreferInPlace' indicates that we will first attempt an in-place upgrade of the Pod.If that fails, it will fall back to the ReCreate, where pod will be recreated.Default value is 'PreferInPlace'
- `resources` (Attributes) Specifies the resources required by the Component.It allows defining the CPU, memory requirements and limits for the Component's containers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--resources))
- `runtime_class_name` (String) Defines runtimeClassName for all Pods managed by this Component.
- `scheduling_policy` (Attributes) Specifies the scheduling policy for the Component. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--scheduling_policy))
- `service_account_name` (String) Specifies the name of the ServiceAccount required by the running Component.This ServiceAccount is used to grant necessary permissions for the Component's Pods to interactwith other Kubernetes resources, such as modifying Pod labels or sending events.Defaults:If not specified, KubeBlocks automatically assigns a default ServiceAccount named 'kb-{cluster.name}',bound to a default role defined during KubeBlocks installation.Future Changes:Future versions might change the default ServiceAccount creation strategy to one per Component,potentially revising the naming to 'kb-{cluster.name}-{component.name}'.Users can override the automatic ServiceAccount assignment by explicitly setting the name ofan existed ServiceAccount in this field.
- `service_refs` (Attributes List) Defines a list of ServiceRef for a Component, enabling access to both external services andServices provided by other Clusters.Types of services:- External services: Not managed by KubeBlocks or managed by a different KubeBlocks operator;  Require a ServiceDescriptor for connection details.- Services provided by a Cluster: Managed by the same KubeBlocks operator;  identified using Cluster, Component and Service names.ServiceRefs with identical 'serviceRef.name' in the same Cluster are considered the same.Example:'''yamlserviceRefs:  - name: 'redis-sentinel'    serviceDescriptor:      name: 'external-redis-sentinel'  - name: 'postgres-cluster'    clusterServiceSelector:      cluster: 'my-postgres-cluster'      service:        component: 'postgresql''''The example above includes ServiceRefs to an external Redis Sentinel service and a PostgreSQL Cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--service_refs))
- `service_version` (String) ServiceVersion specifies the version of the Service expected to be provisioned by this Component.The version should follow the syntax and semantics of the 'Semantic Versioning' specification (http://semver.org/).
- `services` (Attributes List) Overrides Services defined in referenced ComponentDefinition and exposes endpoints that can be accessedby clients. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--services))
- `stop` (Boolean) Stop the Component.If set, all the computing resources will be released.
- `system_accounts` (Attributes List) Overrides system accounts defined in referenced ComponentDefinition. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--system_accounts))
- `tls_config` (Attributes) Specifies the TLS configuration for the Component, including:- A boolean flag that indicates whether the Component should use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for secure communication.- An optional field that specifies the configuration for the TLS certificates issuer when TLS is enabled.  It allows defining the issuer name and the reference to the secret containing the TLS certificates and key.	 The secret should contain the CA certificate, TLS certificate, and private key in the specified keys. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--tls_config))
- `tolerations` (Attributes List) Allows Pods to be scheduled onto nodes with matching taints.Each toleration in the array allows the Pod to tolerate node taints based onspecified 'key', 'value', 'effect', and 'operator'.- The 'key', 'value', and 'effect' identify the taint that the toleration matches.- The 'operator' determines how the toleration matches the taint.Pods with matching tolerations are allowed to be scheduled on tainted nodes, typically reserved for specific purposes.Deprecated since v0.10, replaced by the 'schedulingPolicy' field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--tolerations))
- `volume_claim_templates` (Attributes List) Specifies a list of PersistentVolumeClaim templates that define the storage requirements for the Component.Each template specifies the desired characteristics of a persistent volume, such as storage class,size, and access modes.These templates are used to dynamically provision persistent volumes for the Component. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volume_claim_templates))
- `volumes` (Attributes List) List of volumes to override. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volumes))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--affinity"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.affinity`

Optional:

- `node_labels` (Map of String) Indicates the node labels that must be present on nodes for pods to be scheduled on them.It is a map where the keys are the label keys and the values are the corresponding label values.Pods will only be scheduled on nodes that have all the specified labels with the corresponding values.For example, if NodeLabels is set to {'nodeType': 'ssd', 'environment': 'production'},pods will only be scheduled on nodes that have both the 'nodeType' label with value 'ssd'and the 'environment' label with value 'production'.This field allows users to control Pod placement based on specific node labels.It can be used to ensure that Pods are scheduled on nodes with certain characteristics,such as specific hardware (e.g., SSD), environment (e.g., production, staging),or any other custom labels assigned to nodes.
- `pod_anti_affinity` (String) Specifies the anti-affinity level of Pods within a Component.It determines how pods should be spread across nodes to improve availability and performance.It can have the following values: 'Preferred' and 'Required'.The default value is 'Preferred'.
- `tenancy` (String) Determines the level of resource isolation between Pods.It can have the following values: 'SharedNode' and 'DedicatedNode'.- SharedNode: Allow that multiple Pods may share the same node, which is the default behavior of K8s.- DedicatedNode: Each Pod runs on a dedicated node, ensuring that no two Pods share the same node.  In other words, if a Pod is already running on a node, no other Pods will be scheduled on that node.  Which provides a higher level of isolation and resource guarantee for Pods. The default value is 'SharedNode'.
- `topology_keys` (List of String) Represents the key of node labels used to define the topology domain for Pod anti-affinityand Pod spread constraints.In K8s, a topology domain is a set of nodes that have the same value for a specific label key.Nodes with labels containing any of the specified TopologyKeys and identical values are consideredto be in the same topology domain.Note: The concept of topology in the context of K8s TopologyKeys is different from the concept oftopology in the ClusterDefinition.When a Pod has anti-affinity or spread constraints specified, Kubernetes will attempt to schedule thePod on nodes with different values for the specified TopologyKeys.This ensures that Pods are spread across different topology domains, promoting high availability andreducing the impact of node failures.Some well-known label keys, such as 'kubernetes.io/hostname' and 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone',are often used as TopologyKey.These keys represent the hostname and zone of a node, respectively.By including these keys in the TopologyKeys list, Pods will be spread across nodes withdifferent hostnames or zones.In addition to the well-known keys, users can also specify custom label keys as TopologyKeys.This allows for more flexible and custom topology definitions based on the specific needsof the application or environment.The TopologyKeys field is a slice of strings, where each string represents a label key.The order of the keys in the slice does not matter.

### Nested Schema for `spec.instances.scheduling_policy.tolerations`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod cantolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must beof effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero andnegative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--instances--scheduling_policy--topology_spread_constraints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.instances.scheduling_policy.topology_spread_constraints`

Required:

- `max_skew` (Number) MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.When 'whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule', it is the maximum permitted differencebetween the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domainor zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the samelabelSelector spread as 2/2/1:In this case, the global minimum is 1.| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 ||  P P  |  P P  |   P   |- if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)violate MaxSkew(1).- if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.When 'whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway', it is used to give higher precedenceto topologies that satisfy it.It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
- `topology_key` (String) TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this keyand identical values are considered to be in the same topology.We consider each <key, value> as a 'bucket', and try to put balanced numberof pods into each bucket.We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements ofnodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.e.g. If TopologyKey is 'kubernetes.io/hostname', each Node is a domain of that topology.And, if TopologyKey is 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', each zone is a domain of that topology.It's a required field.
- `when_unsatisfiable` (String) WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfythe spread constraint.- DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.- ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the  skew.A constraint is considered 'Unsatisfiable' for an incoming podif and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate'MaxSkew' on some topology.For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the samelabelSelector spread as 3/1/1:| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 || P P P |   P   |   P   |If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduledto zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfiesMaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but schedulerwon't make it *more* imbalanced.It's a required field.

Optional:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector is used to find matching pods.Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of podsin their corresponding topology domain. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--instances--scheduling_policy--topology_spread_constraints--label_selector))
- `match_label_keys` (List of String) MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over whichspreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from theincoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelectorto select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculatedfor the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels willbe ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `min_domains` (Number) MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,Pod Topology Spread treats 'global minimum' as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,this value has no effect on scheduling.As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.Valid values are integers greater than 0.When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the samelabelSelector spread as 2/2/2:| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 ||  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so 'global minimum' is treated as 0.In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,it will violate MaxSkew.This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `node_affinity_policy` (String) NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelectorwhen calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are:- Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations.- Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy.This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
- `node_taints_policy` (String) NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculatingpod topology spread skew. Options are:- Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming podhas a toleration, are included.- Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

Optional:

- `volume_claim_template` (Attributes) Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be theowner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with thepod.  The name of the PVC will be '<pod name>-<volume name>' where'<volume name>' is the name from the 'PodSpec.Volumes' arrayentry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated nameis not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the podwill *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelatedvolume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked untilthe unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC ismeant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with anowner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normallythis should not be necessary, but it may be useful whenmanually reconstructing a broken cluster.This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetesto the PVC after it has been created.Required, must not be nil.

Optional:

- `metadata` (Attributes) May contain labels and annotations that will be copied into the PVCwhen creating it. No other fields are allowed and will be rejected duringvalidation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--metadata))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec"></a>

(see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--instances--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source))
- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-emptyvolume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (noncore object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type ofthe specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamicprovisioner.This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as suchif both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwardscompatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the samevalue automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is  specified.* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects  in any namespaces.(Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.(Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

- `volume_attributes_class_name` (String) volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim.If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes definedin the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClasswill be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClasswill be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will beset to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resourceexists.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#volumeattributesclass(Alpha) Using this field requires the VolumeAttributesClass feature gate to be enabled.
- `volume_mode` (String) volumeMode defines what type of volume is required by the claim.Value of Filesystem is implied when not included in claim spec.
- `volume_name` (String) volumeName is the binding reference to the PersistentVolume backing this claim.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--scheduling_policy--tolerations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.scheduling_policy.tolerations`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod cantolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must beof effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero andnegative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
- `value` (String) Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--scheduling_policy--topology_spread_constraints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.scheduling_policy.topology_spread_constraints`

Required:

- `max_skew` (Number) MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.When 'whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule', it is the maximum permitted differencebetween the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domainor zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the samelabelSelector spread as 2/2/1:In this case, the global minimum is 1.| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 ||  P P  |  P P  |   P   |- if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)violate MaxSkew(1).- if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.When 'whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway', it is used to give higher precedenceto topologies that satisfy it.It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
- `topology_key` (String) TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this keyand identical values are considered to be in the same topology.We consider each <key, value> as a 'bucket', and try to put balanced numberof pods into each bucket.We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements ofnodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.e.g. If TopologyKey is 'kubernetes.io/hostname', each Node is a domain of that topology.And, if TopologyKey is 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', each zone is a domain of that topology.It's a required field.
- `when_unsatisfiable` (String) WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfythe spread constraint.- DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.- ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the  skew.A constraint is considered 'Unsatisfiable' for an incoming podif and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate'MaxSkew' on some topology.For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the samelabelSelector spread as 3/1/1:| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 || P P P |   P   |   P   |If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduledto zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfiesMaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but schedulerwon't make it *more* imbalanced.It's a required field.

Optional:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector is used to find matching pods.Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of podsin their corresponding topology domain. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--scheduling_policy--topology_spread_constraints--label_selector))
- `match_label_keys` (List of String) MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over whichspreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from theincoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelectorto select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculatedfor the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels willbe ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `min_domains` (Number) MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,Pod Topology Spread treats 'global minimum' as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,this value has no effect on scheduling.As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.Valid values are integers greater than 0.When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the samelabelSelector spread as 2/2/2:| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 ||  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so 'global minimum' is treated as 0.In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,it will violate MaxSkew.This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `node_affinity_policy` (String) NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelectorwhen calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are:- Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations.- Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy.This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
- `node_taints_policy` (String) NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculatingpod topology spread skew. Options are:- Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming podhas a toleration, are included.- Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

### Nested Schema for `spec.service_refs.cluster_service_selector.service`

Required:

- `service` (String) The name of the Service to be referenced.Leave it empty to reference the default Service. Set it to 'headless' to reference the default headless Service.If the referenced Service is of pod-service type (a Service per Pod), there will be multiple Service objects matched,and the resolved value will be presented in the following format: service1.name,service2.name...

Optional:

- `port` (String) The port name of the Service to be referenced.If there is a non-zero node-port exist for the matched Service port, the node-port will be selected first.If the referenced Service is of pod-service type (a Service per Pod), there will be multiple Service objects matched,and the resolved value will be presented in the following format: service1.name:port1,service2.name:port2...




<a id="nestedatt--spec--services"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.services`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name defines the name of the service.otherwise, it indicates the name of the service.Others can refer to this service by its name. (e.g., connection credential)Cannot be updated.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) If ServiceType is LoadBalancer, cloud provider related parameters can be put hereMore info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer.
- `disable_auto_provision` (Boolean) Indicates whether the automatic provisioning of the service should be disabled.If set to true, the service will not be automatically created at the component provisioning.Instead, you can enable the creation of this service by specifying it explicitly in the cluster API.
- `pod_service` (Boolean) Indicates whether to create a corresponding Service for each Pod of the selected Component.When set to true, a set of Services will be automatically generated for each Pod,and the 'roleSelector' field will be ignored.The names of the generated Services will follow the same suffix naming pattern: '$(serviceName)-$(podOrdinal)'.The total number of generated Services will be equal to the number of replicas specified for the Component.Example usage:'''yamlname: my-serviceserviceName: my-servicepodService: truedisableAutoProvision: truespec:  type: NodePort  ports:  - name: http    port: 80    targetPort: 8080'''In this example, if the Component has 3 replicas, three Services will be generated:- my-service-0: Points to the first Pod (podOrdinal: 0)- my-service-1: Points to the second Pod (podOrdinal: 1)- my-service-2: Points to the third Pod (podOrdinal: 2)Each generated Service will have the specified spec configuration and will target its respective Pod.This feature is useful when you need to expose each Pod of a Component individually, allowing external accessto specific instances of the Component.
- `role_selector` (String) Extends the above 'serviceSpec.selector' by allowing you to specify defined role as selector for the service.When 'roleSelector' is set, it adds a label selector 'kubeblocks.io/role: {roleSelector}'to the 'serviceSpec.selector'.Example usage:	  roleSelector: 'leader'In this example, setting 'roleSelector' to 'leader' will add a label selector'kubeblocks.io/role: leader' to the 'serviceSpec.selector'.This means that the service will select and route traffic to Pods with the label'kubeblocks.io/role' set to 'leader'.Note that if 'podService' sets to true, RoleSelector will be ignored.The 'podService' flag takes precedence over 'roleSelector' and generates a service for each Pod.
- `service_name` (String) ServiceName defines the name of the underlying service object.If not specified, the default service name with different patterns will be used:- CLUSTER_NAME: for cluster-level services- CLUSTER_NAME-COMPONENT_NAME: for component-level servicesOnly one default service name is allowed.Cannot be updated.
- `spec` (Attributes) Spec defines the behavior of a service.https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--services--spec))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--services--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.services.spec`

Optional:

- `allocate_load_balancer_node_ports` (Boolean) allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts defines if NodePorts will be automaticallyallocated for services with type LoadBalancer.  Default is 'true'. Itmay be set to 'false' if the cluster load-balancer does not rely onNodePorts.  If the caller requests specific NodePorts (by specifying avalue), those requests will be respected, regardless of this field.This field may only be set for services with type LoadBalancer and willbe cleared if the type is changed to any other type.
- `cluster_i_ps` (List of String) ClusterIPs is a list of IP addresses assigned to this service, and areusually assigned randomly.  If an address is specified manually, isin-range (as per system configuration), and is not in use, it will beallocated to the service; otherwise creation of the service will fail.This field may not be changed through updates unless the type field isalso being changed to ExternalName (which requires this field to beempty) or the type field is being changed from ExternalName (in whichcase this field may optionally be specified, as describe above).  Validvalues are 'None', empty string (''), or a valid IP address.  Settingthis to 'None' makes a 'headless service' (no virtual IP), which isuseful when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying isnot required.  Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, andLoadBalancer. If this field is specified when creating a Service of typeExternalName, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updatinga Service to type ExternalName.  If this field is not specified, it willbe initialized from the clusterIP field.  If this field is specified,clients must ensure that clusterIPs[0] and clusterIP have the samevalue.This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack IPs, in either order).These IPs must correspond to the values of the ipFamilies field. BothclusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `cluster_ip` (String) clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assignedrandomly. If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as persystem configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to theservice; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field may notbe changed through updates unless the type field is also being changedto ExternalName (which requires this field to be blank) or the typefield is being changed from ExternalName (in which case this field mayoptionally be specified, as describe above).  Valid values are 'None',empty string (''), or a valid IP address. Setting this to 'None' makes a'headless service' (no virtual IP), which is useful when direct endpointconnections are preferred and proxying is not required.  Only applies totypes ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specifiedwhen creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. Thisfield will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `external_i_ps` (List of String) externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the clusterwill also accept traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed byKubernetes.  The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrivesat a node with this IP.  A common example is external load-balancersthat are not part of the Kubernetes system.
- `external_name` (String) externalName is the external reference that discovery mechanisms willreturn as an alias for this service (e.g. a DNS CNAME record). Noproxying will be involved.  Must be a lowercase RFC-1123 hostname(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires 'type' to be 'ExternalName'.
- `external_traffic_policy` (String) externalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic theyreceive on one of the Service's 'externally-facing' addresses (NodePorts,ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to 'Local', the proxy will configurethe service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take careof balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will delivertraffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masqueradingthe client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints willbe dropped.) The default value, 'Cluster', uses the standard behavior ofrouting to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and otherfeatures). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP fromwithin the cluster will always get 'Cluster' semantics, but clients sending toa NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into accountwhen picking a node.
- `health_check_node_port` (Number) healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service.This only applies when type is set to LoadBalancer andexternalTrafficPolicy is set to Local. If a value is specified, isin-range, and is not in use, it will be used.  If not specified, a valuewill be automatically allocated.  External systems (e.g. load-balancers)can use this port to determine if a given node holds endpoints for thisservice or not.  If this field is specified when creating a Servicewhich does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wipedwhen updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type).This field cannot be updated once set.
- `internal_traffic_policy` (String) InternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic theyreceive on the ClusterIP. If set to 'Local', the proxy will assume that podsonly want to talk to endpoints of the service on the same node as the pod,dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value,'Cluster', uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly(possibly modified by topology and other features).
- `ip_families` (List of String) IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to thisservice. This field is usually assigned automatically based on clusterconfiguration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If this field is specifiedmanually, the requested family is available in the cluster,and ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation ofthe service will fail. This field is conditionally mutable: it allowsfor adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not allowchanging the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are 'IPv4'and 'IPv6'.  This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP,NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to 'headless' services.This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, ineither order).  These families must correspond to the values of theclusterIPs field, if specified. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies aregoverned by the ipFamilyPolicy field.
- `ip_family_policy` (String) IPFamilyPolicy represents the dual-stack-ness requested or required bythis Service. If there is no value provided, then this field will be setto SingleStack. Services can be 'SingleStack' (a single IP family),'PreferDualStack' (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters ora single IP family on single-stack clusters), or 'RequireDualStack'(two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters, otherwise fail). TheipFamilies and clusterIPs fields depend on the value of this field. Thisfield will be wiped when updating a service to type ExternalName.
- `load_balancer_class` (String) loadBalancerClass is the class of the load balancer implementation this Service belongs to.If specified, the value of this field must be a label-style identifier, with an optional prefix,e.g. 'internal-vip' or 'example.com/internal-vip'. Unprefixed names are reserved for end-users.This field can only be set when the Service type is 'LoadBalancer'. If not set, the default loadbalancer implementation is used, today this is typically done through the cloud provider integration,but should apply for any default implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancerimplementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancerimplementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field.This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type 'LoadBalancer'.Once set, it can not be changed. This field will be wiped when a service is updated to a non 'LoadBalancer' type.
- `load_balancer_ip` (String) Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer.This feature depends on whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifyingthe loadBalancerIP when a load balancer is created.This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.Deprecated: This field was under-specified and its meaning varies across implementations.Using it is non-portable and it may not support dual-stack.Users are encouraged to use implementation-specific annotations when available.
- `load_balancer_source_ranges` (List of String) If specified and supported by the platform, this will restrict traffic through the cloud-providerload-balancer will be restricted to the specified client IPs. This field will be ignored if thecloud-provider does not support the feature.'More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/
- `ports` (Attributes List) The list of ports that are exposed by this service.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--services--spec--ports))
- `publish_not_ready_addresses` (Boolean) publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints for thisService should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready.The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service topropagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery.The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources forServices interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered 'ready' even if thePods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpointsthrough the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.
- `selector` (Map of String) Route service traffic to pods with label keys and values matching thisselector. If empty or not present, the service is assumed to have anexternal process managing its endpoints, which Kubernetes will notmodify. Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.Ignored if type is ExternalName.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/
- `session_affinity` (String) Supports 'ClientIP' and 'None'. Used to maintain session affinity.Enable client IP based session affinity.Must be ClientIP or None.Defaults to None.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `session_affinity_config` (Attributes) sessionAffinityConfig contains the configurations of session affinity. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--services--spec--session_affinity_config))
- `type` (String) type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Validoptions are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.'ClusterIP' allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancingto endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is notspecified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object orEndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is 'None', no virtual IP isallocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints ratherthan a virtual IP.'NodePort' builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node whichroutes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.'LoadBalancer' builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer(if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpointsas the clusterIP.'ExternalName' aliases this service to the specified externalName.Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types

- `node_port` (Number) The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type isNodePort or LoadBalancer.  Usually assigned by the system. If a value isspecified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise theoperation will fail.  If not specified, a port will be allocated if thisService requires one.

Normallythis should not be necessary, but it may be useful whenmanually reconstructing a broken cluster.This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetesto the PVC after it has been created.Required, must not be nil. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.volumes.ephemeral.volume_claim_template`

The same fields as in a PersistentVolumeClaimare also valid here. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec))

Optional:

- `metadata` (Attributes) May contain labels and annotations that will be copied into the PVCwhen creating it. No other fields are allowed and will be rejected duringvalidation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--metadata))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.volumes.ephemeral.volume_claim_template.spec`

Optional:

- `access_modes` (List of String) accessModes contains the desired access modes the volume should have.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1
- `data_source` (Attributes) dataSource field can be used to specify either:* An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot)* An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source))
- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-emptyvolume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (noncore object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type ofthe specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamicprovisioner.This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as suchif both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwardscompatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the samevalue automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is  specified.* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects  in any namespaces.(Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.(Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source_ref))

- `selector` (Attributes) selector is a label query over volumes to consider for binding. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--selector))
- `storage_class_name` (String) storageClassName is the name of the StorageClass required by the claim.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1
- `volume_attributes_class_name` (String) volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim.If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes definedin the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClasswill be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClasswill be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will beset to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resourceexists.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#volumeattributesclass(Alpha) Using this field requires the VolumeAttributesClass feature gate to be enabled.
- `volume_mode` (String) volumeMode defines what type of volume is required by the claim.Value of Filesystem is implied when not included in claim spec.
- `volume_name` (String) volumeName is the binding reference to the PersistentVolume backing this claim.
