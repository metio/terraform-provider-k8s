## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.
- `spec` (Attributes) ManagedClusterSpec defines the desired state of ManagedCluster (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Read-Only:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Read-Only:

- `cluster_id` (String) ClusterID, a Random (Version 4) UUID, is a unique value in time and space value representing for child cluster. It is typically generated by the clusternet agent on the successful creation of a 'clusternet-agent' Lease in the child cluster. Also it is not allowed to change on PUT operations.
- `cluster_type` (String) ClusterType denotes the type of the child cluster.
- `sync_mode` (String) SyncMode decides how to sync resources from parent cluster to child cluster.
- `taints` (Attributes List) Taints has the 'effect' on any resource that does not tolerate the Taint. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--taints))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--taints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.taints`

Read-Only:

- `effect` (String) Required. The effect of the taint on pods that do not tolerate the taint. Valid effects are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Required. The taint key to be applied to a node.
- `time_added` (String) TimeAdded represents the time at which the taint was added. It is only written for NoExecute taints.
- `value` (String) The taint value corresponding to the taint key.
