<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `runtime` (Attributes) Specifies the PodSpec template used in the Component. It includes the following elements: - Init containers - Containers - Image - Commands - Args - Envs - Mounts - Ports - Security context - Probes - Lifecycle - Volumes This field is intended to define static settings that remain consistent across all instantiated Components. Dynamic settings such as CPU and memory resource limits, as well as scheduling settings (affinity, toleration, priority), may vary among different instantiated Components. They should be specified in the 'cluster.spec.componentSpecs' (ClusterComponentSpec). Specific instances of a Component may override settings defined here, such as using a different container image or modifying environment variable values. These instance-specific overrides can be specified in 'cluster.spec.componentSpecs[*].instances'. This field is immutable and cannot be updated once set. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime))

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Specifies static annotations that will be patched to all Kubernetes resources created for the Component. Note: If an annotation key in the 'annotations' field conflicts with any system annotations or user-specified annotations, it will be silently ignored to avoid overriding higher-priority annotations. This field is immutable.
- `configs` (Attributes List) Specifies the configuration file templates and volume mount parameters used by the Component. It also includes descriptions of the parameters in the ConfigMaps, such as value range limitations. This field specifies a list of templates that will be rendered into Component containers' configuration files. Each template is represented as a ConfigMap and may contain multiple configuration files, with each file being a key in the ConfigMap. The rendered configuration files will be mounted into the Component's containers according to the specified volume mount parameters. This field is immutable. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--configs))
- `description` (String) Provides a brief and concise explanation of the Component's purpose, functionality, and any relevant details. It serves as a quick reference for users to understand the Component's role and characteristics.
- `exporter` (Attributes) Defines the built-in metrics exporter container. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--exporter))
- `host_network` (Attributes) Specifies the host network configuration for the Component. When 'hostNetwork' option is enabled, the Pods share the host's network namespace and can directly access the host's network interfaces. This means that if multiple Pods need to use the same port, they cannot run on the same host simultaneously due to port conflicts. The DNSPolicy field in the Pod spec determines how containers within the Pod perform DNS resolution. When using hostNetwork, the operator will set the DNSPolicy to 'ClusterFirstWithHostNet'. With this policy, DNS queries will first go through the K8s cluster's DNS service. If the query fails, it will fall back to the host's DNS settings. If set, the DNS policy will be automatically set to 'ClusterFirstWithHostNet'. This field is immutable. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--host_network))
- `labels` (Map of String) Specifies static labels that will be patched to all Kubernetes resources created for the Component. Note: If a label key in the 'labels' field conflicts with any system labels or user-specified labels, it will be silently ignored to avoid overriding higher-priority labels. This field is immutable.
- `lifecycle_actions` (Attributes) Defines a set of hooks and procedures that customize the behavior of a Component throughout its lifecycle. Actions are triggered at specific lifecycle stages: - 'postProvision': Defines the hook to be executed after the creation of a Component, with 'preCondition' specifying when the action should be fired relative to the Component's lifecycle stages: 'Immediately', 'RuntimeReady', 'ComponentReady', and 'ClusterReady'. - 'preTerminate': Defines the hook to be executed before terminating a Component. - 'roleProbe': Defines the procedure which is invoked regularly to assess the role of replicas. - 'switchover': Defines the procedure for a controlled transition of leadership from the current leader to a new replica. This approach aims to minimize downtime and maintain availability in systems with a leader-follower topology, such as before planned maintenance or upgrades on the current leader node. - 'memberJoin': Defines the procedure to add a new replica to the replication group. - 'memberLeave': Defines the method to remove a replica from the replication group. - 'readOnly': Defines the procedure to switch a replica into the read-only state. - 'readWrite': transition a replica from the read-only state back to the read-write state. - 'dataDump': Defines the procedure to export the data from a replica. - 'dataLoad': Defines the procedure to import data into a replica. - 'reconfigure': Defines the procedure that update a replica with new configuration file. - 'accountProvision': Defines the procedure to generate a new database account. This field is immutable. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions))
- `log_configs` (Attributes List) Defines the types of logs generated by instances of the Component and their corresponding file paths. These logs can be collected for further analysis and monitoring. The 'logConfigs' field is an optional list of LogConfig objects, where each object represents a specific log type and its configuration. It allows you to specify multiple log types and their respective file paths for the Component. Examples: '''yaml logConfigs: - filePathPattern: /data/mysql/log/mysqld-error.log name: error - filePathPattern: /data/mysql/log/mysqld.log name: general - filePathPattern: /data/mysql/log/mysqld-slowquery.log name: slow ''' This field is immutable. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--log_configs))
- `min_ready_seconds` (Number) 'minReadySeconds' is the minimum duration in seconds that a new Pod should remain in the ready state without any of its containers crashing to be considered available. This ensures the Pod's stability and readiness to serve requests. A default value of 0 seconds means the Pod is considered available as soon as it enters the ready state.
- `monitor` (Attributes) Deprecated since v0.9 monitor is monitoring config which provided by provider. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--monitor))
- `pod_management_policy` (String) InstanceSet controls the creation of pods during initial scale up, replacement of pods on nodes, and scaling down. - 'OrderedReady': Creates pods in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc). The controller waits until each pod is ready before continuing. Pods are removed in reverse order when scaling down. - 'Parallel': Creates pods in parallel to match the desired scale without waiting. All pods are deleted at once when scaling down.
- `policy_rules` (Attributes List) Defines the namespaced policy rules required by the Component. The 'policyRules' field is an array of 'rbacv1.PolicyRule' objects that define the policy rules needed by the Component to operate within a namespace. These policy rules determine the permissions and verbs the Component is allowed to perform on Kubernetes resources within the namespace. The purpose of this field is to automatically generate the necessary RBAC roles for the Component based on the specified policy rules. This ensures that the Pods in the Component has appropriate permissions to function. Note: This field is currently non-functional and is reserved for future implementation. This field is immutable. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--policy_rules))
- `provider` (String) Specifies the name of the Component provider, typically the vendor or developer name. It identifies the entity responsible for creating and maintaining the Component. When specifying the provider name, consider the following guidelines: - Keep the name concise and relevant to the Component. - Use a consistent naming convention across Components from the same provider. - Avoid using trademarked or copyrighted names without proper permission.
- `replicas_limit` (Attributes) Defines the upper limit of the number of replicas supported by the Component. It defines the maximum number of replicas that can be created for the Component. This field allows you to set a limit on the scalability of the Component, preventing it from exceeding a certain number of replicas. This field is immutable. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--replicas_limit))
- `role_arbitrator` (String) This field has been deprecated since v0.9. This field is maintained for backward compatibility and its use is discouraged. Existing usage should be updated to the current preferred approach to avoid compatibility issues in future releases. This field is immutable.
- `roles` (Attributes List) Enumerate all possible roles assigned to each replica of the Component, influencing its behavior. A replica can have zero to multiple roles. KubeBlocks operator determines the roles of each replica by invoking the 'lifecycleActions.roleProbe' method. This action returns a list of roles for each replica, and the returned roles must be predefined in the 'roles' field. The roles assigned to a replica can influence various aspects of the Component's behavior, such as: - Service selection: The Component's exposed Services may target replicas based on their roles using 'roleSelector'. - Update order: The roles can determine the order in which replicas are updated during a Component update. For instance, replicas with a 'follower' role can be updated first, while the replica with the 'leader' role is updated last. This helps minimize the number of leader changes during the update process. This field is immutable. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--roles))
- `scripts` (Attributes List) Specifies groups of scripts, each provided via a ConfigMap, to be mounted as volumes in the container. These scripts can be executed during container startup or via specific actions. Each script group is encapsulated in a ComponentTemplateSpec that includes: - The ConfigMap containing the scripts. - The mount point where the scripts will be mounted inside the container. This field is immutable. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--scripts))
- `service_kind` (String) Defines the type of well-known service protocol that the Component provides. It specifies the standard or widely recognized protocol used by the Component to offer its Services. The 'serviceKind' field allows users to quickly identify the type of Service provided by the Component based on common protocols or service types. This information helps in understanding the compatibility, interoperability, and usage of the Component within a system. Some examples of well-known service protocols include: - 'MySQL': Indicates that the Component provides a MySQL database service. - 'PostgreSQL': Indicates that the Component offers a PostgreSQL database service. - 'Redis': Signifies that the Component functions as a Redis key-value store. - 'ETCD': Denotes that the Component serves as an ETCD distributed key-value store. The 'serviceKind' value is case-insensitive, allowing for flexibility in specifying the protocol name. When specifying the 'serviceKind', consider the following guidelines: - Use well-established and widely recognized protocol names or service types. - Ensure that the 'serviceKind' accurately represents the primary service type offered by the Component. - If the Component provides multiple services, choose the most prominent or commonly used protocol. - Limit the 'serviceKind' to a maximum of 32 characters for conciseness and readability. Note: The 'serviceKind' field is optional and can be left empty if the Component does not fit into a well-known service category or if the protocol is not widely recognized. It is primarily used to convey information about the Component's service type to users and facilitate discovery and integration. The 'serviceKind' field is immutable and cannot be updated.
- `service_ref_declarations` (Attributes List) Lists external service dependencies of the Component, including services from other Clusters or outside the K8s environment. This field is immutable. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--service_ref_declarations))
- `service_version` (String) Specifies the version of the Service provided by the Component. It follows the syntax and semantics of the 'Semantic Versioning' specification (http://semver.org/). The Semantic Versioning specification defines a version number format of X.Y.Z (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH), where: - X represents the major version and indicates incompatible API changes. - Y represents the minor version and indicates added functionality in a backward-compatible manner. - Z represents the patch version and indicates backward-compatible bug fixes. Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the X.Y.Z format: - Use pre-release labels (e.g., -alpha, -beta) for versions that are not yet stable or ready for production use. - Use build metadata (e.g., +build.1) for additional version information if needed. Examples of valid ServiceVersion values: - '1.0.0' - '2.3.1' - '3.0.0-alpha.1' - '4.5.2+build.1' The 'serviceVersion' field is immutable and cannot be updated.
- `services` (Attributes List) Defines additional Services to expose the Component's endpoints. A default headless Service, named '{cluster.name}-{component.name}-headless', is automatically created for internal Cluster communication. This field enables customization of additional Services to expose the Component's endpoints to other Components within the same or different Clusters, and to external applications. Each Service entry in this list can include properties such as ports, type, and selectors. - For intra-Cluster access, Components can reference Services using variables declared in 'componentDefinition.spec.vars[*].valueFrom.serviceVarRef'. - For inter-Cluster access, reference Services use variables declared in 'componentDefinition.spec.vars[*].valueFrom.serviceRefVarRef', and bind Services at Cluster creation time with 'clusterComponentSpec.ServiceRef[*].clusterServiceSelector'. This field is immutable. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--services))
- `system_accounts` (Attributes List) An array of 'SystemAccount' objects that define the system accounts needed for the management operations of the Component. Each 'SystemAccount' includes: - Account name. - The SQL statement template: Used to create the system account. - Password Source: Either generated based on certain rules or retrieved from a Secret. Use cases for system accounts typically involve tasks like system initialization, backups, monitoring, health checks, replication, and other system-level operations. System accounts are distinct from user accounts, although both are database accounts. - **System Accounts**: Created during Cluster setup by the KubeBlocks operator, these accounts have higher privileges for system management and are fully managed through a declarative API by the operator. - **User Accounts**: Managed by users or administrator. User account permissions should follow the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary access rights to complete their required tasks. This field is immutable. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--system_accounts))
- `update_strategy` (String) Specifies the concurrency strategy for updating multiple instances of the Component. Available strategies: - 'Serial': Updates replicas one at a time, ensuring minimal downtime by waiting for each replica to become ready before updating the next. - 'Parallel': Updates all replicas simultaneously, optimizing for speed but potentially reducing availability during the update. - 'BestEffortParallel': Updates replicas concurrently with a limit on simultaneous updates to ensure a minimum number of operational replicas for maintaining quorum. For example, in a 5-replica component, updating a maximum of 2 replicas simultaneously keeps at least 3 operational for quorum. This field is immutable and defaults to 'Serial'.
- `vars` (Attributes List) Defines variables which are determined after Cluster instantiation and reflect dynamic or runtime attributes of instantiated Clusters. These variables serve as placeholders for setting environment variables in Pods and Actions, or for rendering configuration and script templates before actual values are finalized. These variables are placed in front of the environment variables declared in the Pod if used as environment variables. Variable values can be sourced from: - ConfigMap: Select and extract a value from a specific key within a ConfigMap. - Secret: Select and extract a value from a specific key within a Secret. - HostNetwork: Retrieves values (including ports) from host-network resources. - Service: Retrieves values (including address, port, NodePort) from a selected Service. Intended to obtain the address of a ComponentService within the same Cluster. - Credential: Retrieves account name and password from a SystemAccount variable. - ServiceRef: Retrieves address, port, account name and password from a selected ServiceRefDeclaration. Designed to obtain the address bound to a ServiceRef, such as a ClusterService or ComponentService of another cluster or an external service. - Component: Retrieves values from a selected Component, including replicas and instance name list. This field is immutable. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--vars))
- `volumes` (Attributes List) Defines the volumes used by the Component and some static attributes of the volumes. After defining the volumes here, user can reference them in the 'cluster.spec.componentSpecs[*].volumeClaimTemplates' field to configure dynamic properties such as volume capacity and storage class. This field allows you to specify the following: - Snapshot behavior: Determines whether a snapshot of the volume should be taken when performing a snapshot backup of the Component. - Disk high watermark: Sets the high watermark for the volume's disk usage. When the disk usage reaches the specified threshold, it triggers an alert or action. By configuring these volume behaviors, you can control how the volumes are managed and monitored within the Component. This field is immutable. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volumes))

If set to true or not present, the pod will be run in the host user namespace, useful for when the pod needs a feature only available to the host user namespace, such as loading a kernel module with CAP_SYS_MODULE. When set to false, a new userns is created for the pod. Setting false is useful for mitigating container breakout vulnerabilities even allowing users to run their containers as root without actually having root privileges on the host. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the UserNamespacesSupport feature.
- `hostname` (String) Specifies the hostname of the Pod If not specified, the pod's hostname will be set to a system-defined value.

If any init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be unique among all containers. Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes. The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of of that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers in a similar fashion. Init containers cannot currently be added or removed. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/ (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--init_containers))

- `overhead` (Map of String) Overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for a given RuntimeClass. This field will be autopopulated at admission time by the RuntimeClass admission controller. If the RuntimeClass admission controller is enabled, overhead must not be set in Pod create requests. The RuntimeClass admission controller will reject Pod create requests which have the overhead already set. If RuntimeClass is configured and selected in the PodSpec, Overhead will be set to the value defined in the corresponding RuntimeClass, otherwise it will remain unset and treated as zero. More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/688-pod-overhead/README.md
- `preemption_policy` (String) PreemptionPolicy is the Policy for preempting pods with lower priority. One of Never, PreemptLowerPriority. Defaults to PreemptLowerPriority if unset.
- `priority` (Number) The priority value. Various system components use this field to find the priority of the pod. When Priority Admission Controller is enabled, it prevents users from setting this field. The admission controller populates this field from PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher the priority.
- `priority_class_name` (String) If specified, indicates the pod's priority. 'system-node-critical' and 'system-cluster-critical' are two special keywords which indicate the highest priorities with the former being the highest priority. Any other name must be defined by creating a PriorityClass object with that name. If not specified, the pod priority will be default or zero if there is no default.
- `readiness_gates` (Attributes List) If specified, all readiness gates will be evaluated for pod readiness. A pod is ready when all its containers are ready AND all conditions specified in the readiness gates have status equal to 'True' More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-network/580-pod-readiness-gates (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--readiness_gates))
- `resource_claims` (Attributes List) ResourceClaims defines which ResourceClaims must be allocated and reserved before the Pod is allowed to start. The resources will be made available to those containers which consume them by name. This is an alpha field and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate. This field is immutable. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--resource_claims))
- `restart_policy` (String) Restart policy for all containers within the pod. One of Always, OnFailure, Never. In some contexts, only a subset of those values may be permitted. Default to Always. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy
- `runtime_class_name` (String) RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io group, which should be used to run this pod. If no RuntimeClass resource matches the named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, the 'legacy' RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an empty definition that uses the default runtime handler. More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/585-runtime-class
- `scheduler_name` (String) If specified, the pod will be dispatched by specified scheduler. If not specified, the pod will be dispatched by default scheduler.
- `scheduling_gates` (Attributes List) SchedulingGates is an opaque list of values that if specified will block scheduling the pod. If schedulingGates is not empty, the pod will stay in the SchedulingGated state and the scheduler will not attempt to schedule the pod. SchedulingGates can only be set at pod creation time, and be removed only afterwards. This is a beta feature enabled by the PodSchedulingReadiness feature gate. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--scheduling_gates))
- `security_context` (Attributes) SecurityContext holds pod-level security attributes and common container settings. Optional: Defaults to empty. See type description for default values of each field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--security_context))
- `service_account` (String) DeprecatedServiceAccount is a depreciated alias for ServiceAccountName. Deprecated: Use serviceAccountName instead.
- `service_account_name` (String) ServiceAccountName is the name of the ServiceAccount to use to run this pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/
- `set_hostname_as_fqdn` (Boolean) If true the pod's hostname will be configured as the pod's FQDN, rather than the leaf name (the default). In Linux containers, this means setting the FQDN in the hostname field of the kernel (the nodename field of struct utsname). In Windows containers, this means setting the registry value of hostname for the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesTcpipParameters to FQDN. If a pod does not have FQDN, this has no effect. Default to false.
- `share_process_namespace` (Boolean) Share a single process namespace between all of the containers in a pod. When this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes from other containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both be set. Optional: Default to false.
- `subdomain` (String) If specified, the fully qualified Pod hostname will be '<hostname>.<subdomain>.<pod namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>'. If not specified, the pod will not have a domainname at all.
- `termination_grace_period_seconds` (Number) Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully. May be decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). If this value is nil, the default grace period will be used instead. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. Defaults to 30 seconds.
- `tolerations` (Attributes List) If specified, the pod's tolerations. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--tolerations))

### Nested Schema for `spec.runtime.containers`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the container specified as a DNS_LABEL. Each container in a pod must have a unique name (DNS_LABEL). Cannot be updated.

Optional:

- `args` (List of String) Arguments to the entrypoint. The container image's CMD is used if this is not provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. '$$(VAR_NAME)' will produce the string literal '$(VAR_NAME)'. Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell
- `command` (List of String) Entrypoint array. Not executed within a shell. The container image's ENTRYPOINT is used if this is not provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. '$$(VAR_NAME)' will produce the string literal '$(VAR_NAME)'. Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell
- `env` (Attributes List) List of environment variables to set in the container. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--containers--env))
- `env_from` (Attributes List) List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys will be reported as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists in multiple sources, the value associated with the last source will take precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--containers--env_from))
- `image` (String) Container image name. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images This field is optional to allow higher level config management to default or override container images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.
- `image_pull_policy` (String) Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images
- `lifecycle` (Attributes) Actions that the management system should take in response to container lifecycle events. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--containers--lifecycle))
- `liveness_probe` (Attributes) Periodic probe of container liveness. Container will be restarted if the probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--containers--liveness_probe))
- `ports` (Attributes List) List of ports to expose from the container. Not specifying a port here DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the default '0.0.0.0' address inside a container will be accessible from the network. Modifying this array with strategic merge patch may corrupt the data. For more information See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108255. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--containers--ports))
- `readiness_probe` (Attributes) Periodic probe of container service readiness. Container will be removed from service endpoints if the probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--containers--readiness_probe))
- `resize_policy` (Attributes List) Resources resize policy for the container. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--containers--resize_policy))
- `resources` (Attributes) Compute Resources required by this container. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/ (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--containers--resources))
- `restart_policy` (String) RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod. This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is 'Always'. For non-init containers or when this field is not specified, the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type. Setting the RestartPolicy as 'Always' for the init container will have the following effect: this init container will be continually restarted on exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy 'Always' will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and is often referred to as a 'sidecar' container. Although this init container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully completed.
- `security_context` (Attributes) SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with. If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/ (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--containers--security_context))
- `startup_probe` (Attributes) StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--containers--startup_probe))
- `stdin` (Boolean) Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF. Default is false.
- `stdin_once` (Boolean) Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false
- `termination_message_path` (String) Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
- `termination_message_policy` (String) Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
- `tty` (Boolean) Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false.
- `volume_devices` (Attributes List) volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--containers--volume_devices))
- `volume_mounts` (Attributes List) Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--containers--volume_mounts))
- `working_dir` (String) Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's default will be used, which might be configured in the container image. Cannot be updated.

If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false
- `target_container_name` (String) If set, the name of the container from PodSpec that this ephemeral container targets. The ephemeral container will be run in the namespaces (IPC, PID, etc) of this container. If not set then the ephemeral container uses the namespaces configured in the Pod spec. The container runtime must implement support for this feature. If the runtime does not support namespace targeting then the result of setting this field is undefined.
- `termination_message_path` (String) Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
- `termination_message_policy` (String) Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
- `tty` (Boolean) Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false.
- `volume_devices` (Attributes List) volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--ephemeral_containers--volume_devices))
- `volume_mounts` (Attributes List) Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Subpath mounts are not allowed for ephemeral containers. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--ephemeral_containers--volume_mounts))
- `working_dir` (String) Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's default will be used, which might be configured in the container image. Cannot be updated.

If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. '$$(VAR_NAME)' will produce the string literal '$(VAR_NAME)'. Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell
- `command` (List of String) Entrypoint array. Not executed within a shell. The container image's ENTRYPOINT is used if this is not provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell
- `env` (Attributes List) List of environment variables to set in the container. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--init_containers--env))
- `env_from` (Attributes List) List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys will be reported as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists in multiple sources, the value associated with the last source will take precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--init_containers--env_from))
- `image` (String) Container image name. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images This field is optional to allow higher level config management to default or override container images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.
- `image_pull_policy` (String) Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images

- `ports` (Attributes List) List of ports to expose from the container. Not specifying a port here DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the default '0.0.0.0' address inside a container will be accessible from the network. Modifying this array with strategic merge patch may corrupt the data. For more information See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108255. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--init_containers--ports))
- `readiness_probe` (Attributes) Periodic probe of container service readiness. Container will be removed from service endpoints if the probe fails. Cannot be updated.

- `restart_policy` (String) RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod. This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is 'Always'. For non-init containers or when this field is not specified, the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type. Setting the RestartPolicy as 'Always' for the init container will have the following effect: this init container will be continually restarted on exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy 'Always' will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and is often referred to as a 'sidecar' container. Although this init container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully completed.
- `security_context` (Attributes) SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with. If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/ (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--init_containers--security_context))
- `startup_probe` (Attributes) StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--init_containers--startup_probe))
- `stdin` (Boolean) Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF. Default is false.
- `stdin_once` (Boolean) Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false
- `termination_message_path` (String) Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
- `termination_message_policy` (String) Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
- `tty` (Boolean) Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false.
- `volume_devices` (Attributes List) volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--init_containers--volume_devices))
- `volume_mounts` (Attributes List) Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--init_containers--volume_mounts))
- `working_dir` (String) Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's default will be used, which might be configured in the container image. Cannot be updated.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--runtime--tolerations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.runtime.tolerations`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
- `value` (String) Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--runtime--topology_spread_constraints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.runtime.topology_spread_constraints`

Required:

- `max_skew` (Number) MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule', it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P | P P | P | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway', it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
- `topology_key` (String) TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a 'bucket', and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is 'kubernetes.io/hostname', each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey is 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', each zone is a domain of that topology. It's a required field.
- `when_unsatisfiable` (String) WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location, but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the skew. A constraint is considered 'Unsatisfiable' for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate 'MaxSkew' on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P | P | P | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

Optional:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--topology_spread_constraints--label_selector))
- `match_label_keys` (List of String) MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector. MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector. This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `min_domains` (Number) MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread treats 'global minimum' as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P | P P | P P | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so 'global minimum' is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew. This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `node_affinity_policy` (String) NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations. - Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations. If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
- `node_taints_policy` (String) NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included. - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included. If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

The maximum usage on memory medium EmptyDir would be the minimum value between the SizeLimit specified here and the sum of memory limits of all containers in a pod. The default is nil which means that the limit is undefined. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#emptydir


<a id="nestedatt--spec--runtime--volumes--ephemeral"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.runtime.volumes.ephemeral`

Optional:

- `volume_claim_template` (Attributes) Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume. The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the pod. The name of the PVC will be '<pod name>-<volume name>' where '<volume name>' is the name from the 'PodSpec.Volumes' array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long). An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster. This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes to the PVC after it has been created. Required, must not be nil. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template))

Optional:

- `metadata` (Attributes) May contain labels and annotations that will be copied into the PVC when creating it. No other fields are allowed and will be rejected during validation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--metadata))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--runtime--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.runtime.volumes.ephemeral.volume_claim_template.spec`

Optional:

- `access_modes` (List of String) accessModes contains the desired access modes the volume should have. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1
- `data_source` (Attributes) dataSource field can be used to specify either: * An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot) * An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source, it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source. When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef, and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified. If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source))
- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty. There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified. * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source_ref))
- `resources` (Attributes) resources represents the minimum resources the volume should have.

- `selector` (Attributes) selector is a label query over volumes to consider for binding. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--runtime--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--selector))
- `storage_class_name` (String) storageClassName is the name of the StorageClass required by the claim. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1
- `volume_attributes_class_name` (String) volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim. If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes defined in the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName, it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set. If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists. If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource exists. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#volumeattributesclass (Alpha) Using this field requires the VolumeAttributesClass feature gate to be enabled.
- `volume_mode` (String) volumeMode defines what type of volume is required by the claim. Value of Filesystem is implied when not included in claim spec.
- `volume_name` (String) volumeName is the binding reference to the PersistentVolume backing this claim.

If any error occurs during the process, the action must be able to guarantee idempotence to allow for retries from the beginning. Note: This field is immutable once it has been set. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--data_load))
- `member_join` (Attributes) Defines the procedure to add a new replica to the replication group. This action is initiated after a replica pod becomes ready. The role of the replica (e.g., primary, secondary) will be determined and assigned as part of the action command implementation, or automatically by the database kernel or a sidecar utility like Patroni that implements a consensus algorithm. The container executing this action has access to following environment variables: - KB_SERVICE_PORT: The port used by the database service. - KB_SERVICE_USER: The username with the necessary permissions to interact with the database service. - KB_SERVICE_PASSWORD: The corresponding password for KB_SERVICE_USER to authenticate with the database service. - KB_PRIMARY_POD_FQDN: The FQDN of the primary Pod within the replication group. - KB_MEMBER_ADDRESSES: A comma-separated list of Pod addresses for all replicas in the group. - KB_NEW_MEMBER_POD_NAME: The pod name of the replica being added to the group. - KB_NEW_MEMBER_POD_IP: The IP address of the replica being added to the group. Expected action output: - On Failure: An error message detailing the reason for any failure encountered during the addition of the new member. For example, to add a new OBServer to an OceanBase Cluster in 'zone1', the following command may be used: '''yaml command: - bash - -c - | ADDRESS=$(KB_MEMBER_ADDRESSES%%,*) HOST=$(echo $ADDRESS | cut -d ':' -f 1) PORT=$(echo $ADDRESS | cut -d ':' -f 2) CLIENT='mysql -u $KB_SERVICE_USER -p$KB_SERVICE_PASSWORD -P $PORT -h $HOST -e' $CLIENT 'ALTER SYSTEM ADD SERVER '$KB_NEW_MEMBER_POD_IP:$KB_SERVICE_PORT' ZONE 'zone1'' ''' Note: This field is immutable once it has been set. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--member_join))
- `member_leave` (Attributes) Defines the procedure to remove a replica from the replication group. This action is initiated before remove a replica from the group. The operator will wait for MemberLeave to complete successfully before releasing the replica and cleaning up related Kubernetes resources. The process typically includes updating configurations and informing other group members about the removal. Data migration is generally not part of this action and should be handled separately if needed. The container executing this action has access to following environment variables: - KB_SERVICE_PORT: The port used by the database service. - KB_SERVICE_USER: The username with the necessary permissions to interact with the database service. - KB_SERVICE_PASSWORD: The corresponding password for KB_SERVICE_USER to authenticate with the database service. - KB_PRIMARY_POD_FQDN: The FQDN of the primary Pod within the replication group. - KB_MEMBER_ADDRESSES: A comma-separated list of Pod addresses for all replicas in the group. - KB_LEAVE_MEMBER_POD_NAME: The pod name of the replica being removed from the group. - KB_LEAVE_MEMBER_POD_IP: The IP address of the replica being removed from the group. Expected action output: - On Failure: An error message, if applicable, indicating why the action failed. For example, to remove an OBServer from an OceanBase Cluster in 'zone1', the following command can be executed: '''yaml command: - bash - -c - | ADDRESS=$(KB_MEMBER_ADDRESSES%%,*) HOST=$(echo $ADDRESS | cut -d ':' -f 1) PORT=$(echo $ADDRESS | cut -d ':' -f 2) CLIENT='mysql -u $KB_SERVICE_USER -p$KB_SERVICE_PASSWORD -P $PORT -h $HOST -e' $CLIENT 'ALTER SYSTEM DELETE SERVER '$KB_LEAVE_MEMBER_POD_IP:$KB_SERVICE_PORT' ZONE 'zone1'' ''' Note: This field is immutable once it has been set. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--member_leave))
- `post_provision` (Attributes) Specifies the hook to be executed after a component's creation. By setting 'postProvision.customHandler.preCondition', you can determine the specific lifecycle stage at which the action should trigger: 'Immediately', 'RuntimeReady', 'ComponentReady', and 'ClusterReady'. with 'ComponentReady' being the default. The PostProvision Action is intended to run only once. The container executing this action has access to following environment variables: - KB_CLUSTER_POD_IP_LIST: Comma-separated list of the cluster's pod IP addresses (e.g., 'podIp1,podIp2'). - KB_CLUSTER_POD_NAME_LIST: Comma-separated list of the cluster's pod names (e.g., 'pod1,pod2'). - KB_CLUSTER_POD_HOST_NAME_LIST: Comma-separated list of host names, each corresponding to a pod in KB_CLUSTER_POD_NAME_LIST (e.g., 'hostName1,hostName2'). - KB_CLUSTER_POD_HOST_IP_LIST: Comma-separated list of host IP addresses, each corresponding to a pod in KB_CLUSTER_POD_NAME_LIST (e.g., 'hostIp1,hostIp2'). - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_POD_NAME_LIST: Comma-separated list of all pod names within the component (e.g., 'pod1,pod2'). - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_POD_IP_LIST: Comma-separated list of pod IP addresses, matching the order of pods in KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_POD_NAME_LIST (e.g., 'podIp1,podIp2'). - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_POD_HOST_NAME_LIST: Comma-separated list of host names for each pod, matching the order of pods in KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_POD_NAME_LIST (e.g., 'hostName1,hostName2'). - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_POD_HOST_IP_LIST: Comma-separated list of host IP addresses for each pod, matching the order of pods in KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_POD_NAME_LIST (e.g., 'hostIp1,hostIp2'). - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_LIST: Comma-separated list of all cluster components (e.g., 'comp1,comp2'). - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_DELETING_LIST: Comma-separated list of components that are currently being deleted (e.g., 'comp1,comp2'). - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_UNDELETED_LIST: Comma-separated list of components that are not being deleted (e.g., 'comp1,comp2'). Note: This field is immutable once it has been set. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--post_provision))
- `pre_terminate` (Attributes) Specifies the hook to be executed prior to terminating a component. The PreTerminate Action is intended to run only once. This action is executed immediately when a scale-down operation for the Component is initiated. The actual termination and cleanup of the Component and its associated resources will not proceed until the PreTerminate action has completed successfully. The container executing this action has access to following environment variables: - KB_CLUSTER_POD_IP_LIST: Comma-separated list of the cluster's pod IP addresses (e.g., 'podIp1,podIp2'). - KB_CLUSTER_POD_NAME_LIST: Comma-separated list of the cluster's pod names (e.g., 'pod1,pod2'). - KB_CLUSTER_POD_HOST_NAME_LIST: Comma-separated list of host names, each corresponding to a pod in KB_CLUSTER_POD_NAME_LIST (e.g., 'hostName1,hostName2'). - KB_CLUSTER_POD_HOST_IP_LIST: Comma-separated list of host IP addresses, each corresponding to a pod in KB_CLUSTER_POD_NAME_LIST (e.g., 'hostIp1,hostIp2'). - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_POD_NAME_LIST: Comma-separated list of all pod names within the component (e.g., 'pod1,pod2'). - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_POD_IP_LIST: Comma-separated list of pod IP addresses, matching the order of pods in KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_POD_NAME_LIST (e.g., 'podIp1,podIp2'). - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_POD_HOST_NAME_LIST: Comma-separated list of host names for each pod, matching the order of pods in KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_POD_NAME_LIST (e.g., 'hostName1,hostName2'). - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_POD_HOST_IP_LIST: Comma-separated list of host IP addresses for each pod, matching the order of pods in KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_POD_NAME_LIST (e.g., 'hostIp1,hostIp2'). - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_LIST: Comma-separated list of all cluster components (e.g., 'comp1,comp2'). - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_DELETING_LIST: Comma-separated list of components that are currently being deleted (e.g., 'comp1,comp2'). - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_UNDELETED_LIST: Comma-separated list of components that are not being deleted (e.g., 'comp1,comp2'). - KB_CLUSTER_COMPONENT_IS_SCALING_IN: Indicates whether the component is currently scaling in. If this variable is present and set to 'true', it denotes that the component is undergoing a scale-in operation. During scale-in, data rebalancing is necessary to maintain cluster integrity. Contrast this with a cluster deletion scenario where data rebalancing is not required as the entire cluster is being cleaned up. Note: This field is immutable once it has been set. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--pre_terminate))
- `readonly` (Attributes) Defines the procedure to switch a replica into the read-only state. Use Case: This action is invoked when the database's volume capacity nears its upper limit and space is about to be exhausted. The container executing this action has access to following environment variables: - KB_POD_FQDN: The FQDN of the replica pod whose role is being checked. - KB_SERVICE_PORT: The port used by the database service. - KB_SERVICE_USER: The username with the necessary permissions to interact with the database service. - KB_SERVICE_PASSWORD: The corresponding password for KB_SERVICE_USER to authenticate with the database service. Expected action output: - On Failure: An error message, if applicable, indicating why the action failed. Note: This field is immutable once it has been set. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--readonly))
- `readwrite` (Attributes) Defines the procedure to transition a replica from the read-only state back to the read-write state. Use Case: This action is used to bring back a replica that was previously in a read-only state, which restricted write operations, to its normal operational state where it can handle both read and write operations. The container executing this action has access to following environment variables: - KB_POD_FQDN: The FQDN of the replica pod whose role is being checked. - KB_SERVICE_PORT: The port used by the database service. - KB_SERVICE_USER: The username with the necessary permissions to interact with the database service. - KB_SERVICE_PASSWORD: The corresponding password for KB_SERVICE_USER to authenticate with the database service. Expected action output: - On Failure: An error message, if applicable, indicating why the action failed. Note: This field is immutable once it has been set. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--readwrite))
- `reconfigure` (Attributes) Defines the procedure that update a replica with new configuration. Note: This field is immutable once it has been set. This Action is reserved for future versions. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--reconfigure))
- `role_probe` (Attributes) Defines the procedure which is invoked regularly to assess the role of replicas. This action is periodically triggered by Lorry at the specified interval to determine the role of each replica. Upon successful execution, the action's output designates the role of the replica, which should match one of the predefined role names within 'componentDefinition.spec.roles'. The output is then compared with the previous successful execution result. If a role change is detected, an event is generated to inform the controller, which initiates an update of the replica's role. Defining a RoleProbe Action for a Component is required if roles are defined for the Component. It ensures replicas are correctly labeled with their respective roles. Without this, services that rely on roleSelectors might improperly direct traffic to wrong replicas. The container executing this action has access to following environment variables: - KB_POD_FQDN: The FQDN of the Pod whose role is being assessed. - KB_SERVICE_PORT: The port used by the database service. - KB_SERVICE_USER: The username with the necessary permissions to interact with the database service. - KB_SERVICE_PASSWORD: The corresponding password for KB_SERVICE_USER to authenticate with the database service. Expected output of this action: - On Success: The determined role of the replica, which must align with one of the roles specified in the component definition. - On Failure: An error message, if applicable, indicating why the action failed. Note: This field is immutable once it has been set. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--role_probe))
- `switchover` (Attributes) Defines the procedure for a controlled transition of leadership from the current leader to a new replica. This approach aims to minimize downtime and maintain availability in systems with a leader-follower topology, during events such as planned maintenance or when performing stop, shutdown, restart, or upgrade operations involving the current leader node. The container executing this action has access to following environment variables: - KB_SWITCHOVER_CANDIDATE_NAME: The name of the pod for the new leader candidate, which may not be specified (empty). - KB_SWITCHOVER_CANDIDATE_FQDN: The FQDN of the new leader candidate's pod, which may not be specified (empty). - KB_LEADER_POD_IP: The IP address of the current leader's pod prior to the switchover. - KB_LEADER_POD_NAME: The name of the current leader's pod prior to the switchover. - KB_LEADER_POD_FQDN: The FQDN of the current leader's pod prior to the switchover. The environment variables with the following prefixes are deprecated and will be removed in future releases: - KB_REPLICATION_PRIMARY_POD_ - KB_CONSENSUS_LEADER_POD_ Note: This field is immutable once it has been set. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--switchover))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--account_provision"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.lifecycle_actions.account_provision`

Optional:

- `builtin_handler` (String) Specifies the name of the predefined action handler to be invoked for lifecycle actions. Lorry, as a sidecar agent co-located with the database container in the same Pod, includes a suite of built-in action implementations that are tailored to different database engines. These are known as 'builtin' handlers, includes: 'mysql', 'redis', 'mongodb', 'etcd', 'postgresql', 'official-postgresql', 'apecloud-postgresql', 'wesql', 'oceanbase', 'polardbx'. If the 'builtinHandler' field is specified, it instructs Lorry to utilize its internal built-in action handler to execute the specified lifecycle actions. The 'builtinHandler' field is of type 'BuiltinActionHandlerType', which represents the name of the built-in handler. The 'builtinHandler' specified within the same 'ComponentLifecycleActions' should be consistent across all actions. This means that if you specify a built-in handler for one action, you should use the same handler for all other actions throughout the entire 'ComponentLifecycleActions' collection. If you need to define lifecycle actions for database engines not covered by the existing built-in support, or when the pre-existing built-in handlers do not meet your specific needs, you can use the 'customHandler' field to define your own action implementation. Deprecation Notice: - In the future, the 'builtinHandler' field will be deprecated in favor of using the 'customHandler' field for configuring all lifecycle actions. - Instead of using a name to indicate the built-in action implementations in Lorry, the recommended approach will be to explicitly invoke the desired action implementation through a gRPC interface exposed by the sidecar agent. - Developers will have the flexibility to either use the built-in action implementations provided by Lorry or develop their own sidecar agent to implement custom actions and expose them via gRPC interfaces. - This change will allow for greater customization and extensibility of lifecycle actions, as developers can create their own 'builtin' implementations tailored to their specific requirements.
- `custom_handler` (Attributes) Specifies a user-defined hook or procedure that is called to perform the specific lifecycle action. It offers a flexible and expandable approach for customizing the behavior of a Component by leveraging tailored actions. An Action can be implemented as either an ExecAction or an HTTPAction, with future versions planning to support GRPCAction, thereby accommodating unique logic for different database systems within the Action's framework. In future iterations, all built-in handlers are expected to transition to GRPCAction. This change means that Lorry or other sidecar agents will expose the implementation of actions through a GRPC interface for external invocation. Then the controller will interact with these actions via GRPCAction calls. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--account_provision--custom_handler))

Note: This field is reserved for future use and is not currently active.
- `env` (Attributes List) Represents a list of environment variables that will be injected into the container. These variables enable the container to adapt its behavior based on the environment it's running in. This field cannot be updated.

This field is mutually exclusive with the 'container' field; only one of them should be provided. This field cannot be updated.
- `matching_key` (String) Used in conjunction with the 'targetPodSelector' field to refine the selection of target pod(s) for Action execution. The impact of this field depends on the 'targetPodSelector' value: - When 'targetPodSelector' is set to 'Any' or 'All', this field will be ignored. - When 'targetPodSelector' is set to 'Role', only those replicas whose role matches the 'matchingKey' will be selected for the Action. This field cannot be updated. Note: This field is reserved for future use and is not currently active.
- `pre_condition` (String) Specifies the state that the cluster must reach before the Action is executed. Currently, this is only applicable to the 'postProvision' action. The conditions are as follows: - 'Immediately': Executed right after the Component object is created. The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage. - 'RuntimeReady': The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state. - 'ComponentReady': The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state. This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster. - 'ClusterReady': The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state. This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness. This field cannot be updated.
- `retry_policy` (Attributes) Defines the strategy to be taken when retrying the Action after a failure. It specifies the conditions under which the Action should be retried and the limits to apply, such as the maximum number of retries and backoff strategy. This field cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--account_provision--custom_handler--retry_policy))
- `target_pod_selector` (String) Defines the criteria used to select the target Pod(s) for executing the Action. This is useful when there is no default target replica identified. It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in. This field cannot be updated. Note: This field is reserved for future use and is not currently active.
- `timeout_seconds` (Number) Specifies the maximum duration in seconds that the Action is allowed to run. If the Action does not complete within this time frame, it will be terminated. This field cannot be updated.

Optional:

- `args` (List of String) Args represents the arguments that are passed to the 'command' for execution.
- `command` (List of String) Specifies the command to be executed inside the container. The working directory for this command is the container's root directory('/'). Commands are executed directly without a shell environment, meaning shell-specific syntax ('|', etc.) is not supported. If the shell is required, it must be explicitly invoked in the command. A successful execution is indicated by an exit status of 0; any non-zero status signifies a failure.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--data_dump--custom_handler--http"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.lifecycle_actions.data_dump.custom_handler.http`

Required:

- `port` (String) Specifies the target port for the HTTP request. It can be specified either as a numeric value in the range of 1 to 65535, or as a named port that meets the IANA_SVC_NAME specification.

Optional:

### Nested Schema for `spec.lifecycle_actions.data_dump.custom_handler.retry_policy`

Optional:

- `max_retries` (Number) Defines the maximum number of retry attempts that should be made for a given Action. This value is set to 0 by default, indicating that no retries will be made.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--data_load"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.lifecycle_actions.data_load`

Optional:

- `builtin_handler` (String) Specifies the name of the predefined action handler to be invoked for lifecycle actions. Lorry, as a sidecar agent co-located with the database container in the same Pod, includes a suite of built-in action implementations that are tailored to different database engines. These are known as 'builtin' handlers, includes: 'mysql', 'redis', 'mongodb', 'etcd', 'postgresql', 'official-postgresql', 'apecloud-postgresql', 'wesql', 'oceanbase', 'polardbx'. If the 'builtinHandler' field is specified, it instructs Lorry to utilize its internal built-in action handler to execute the specified lifecycle actions. The 'builtinHandler' field is of type 'BuiltinActionHandlerType', which represents the name of the built-in handler. The 'builtinHandler' specified within the same 'ComponentLifecycleActions' should be consistent across all actions. This means that if you specify a built-in handler for one action, you should use the same handler for all other actions throughout the entire 'ComponentLifecycleActions' collection. If you need to define lifecycle actions for database engines not covered by the existing built-in support, or when the pre-existing built-in handlers do not meet your specific needs, you can use the 'customHandler' field to define your own action implementation. Deprecation Notice: - In the future, the 'builtinHandler' field will be deprecated in favor of using the 'customHandler' field for configuring all lifecycle actions. - Instead of using a name to indicate the built-in action implementations in Lorry, the recommended approach will be to explicitly invoke the desired action implementation through a gRPC interface exposed by the sidecar agent. - Developers will have the flexibility to either use the built-in action implementations provided by Lorry or develop their own sidecar agent to implement custom actions and expose them via gRPC interfaces. - This change will allow for greater customization and extensibility of lifecycle actions, as developers can create their own 'builtin' implementations tailored to their specific requirements.
- `custom_handler` (Attributes) Specifies a user-defined hook or procedure that is called to perform the specific lifecycle action. It offers a flexible and expandable approach for customizing the behavior of a Component by leveraging tailored actions. An Action can be implemented as either an ExecAction or an HTTPAction, with future versions planning to support GRPCAction, thereby accommodating unique logic for different database systems within the Action's framework. In future iterations, all built-in handlers are expected to transition to GRPCAction. This change means that Lorry or other sidecar agents will expose the implementation of actions through a GRPC interface for external invocation. Then the controller will interact with these actions via GRPCAction calls. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--data_load--custom_handler))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--member_leave"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.lifecycle_actions.member_leave`

Optional:

- `builtin_handler` (String) Specifies the name of the predefined action handler to be invoked for lifecycle actions. Lorry, as a sidecar agent co-located with the database container in the same Pod, includes a suite of built-in action implementations that are tailored to different database engines. These are known as 'builtin' handlers, includes: 'mysql', 'redis', 'mongodb', 'etcd', 'postgresql', 'official-postgresql', 'apecloud-postgresql', 'wesql', 'oceanbase', 'polardbx'. If the 'builtinHandler' field is specified, it instructs Lorry to utilize its internal built-in action handler to execute the specified lifecycle actions. The 'builtinHandler' field is of type 'BuiltinActionHandlerType', which represents the name of the built-in handler. The 'builtinHandler' specified within the same 'ComponentLifecycleActions' should be consistent across all actions. This means that if you specify a built-in handler for one action, you should use the same handler for all other actions throughout the entire 'ComponentLifecycleActions' collection. If you need to define lifecycle actions for database engines not covered by the existing built-in support, or when the pre-existing built-in handlers do not meet your specific needs, you can use the 'customHandler' field to define your own action implementation. Deprecation Notice: - In the future, the 'builtinHandler' field will be deprecated in favor of using the 'customHandler' field for configuring all lifecycle actions. - Instead of using a name to indicate the built-in action implementations in Lorry, the recommended approach will be to explicitly invoke the desired action implementation through a gRPC interface exposed by the sidecar agent. - Developers will have the flexibility to either use the built-in action implementations provided by Lorry or develop their own sidecar agent to implement custom actions and expose them via gRPC interfaces. - This change will allow for greater customization and extensibility of lifecycle actions, as developers can create their own 'builtin' implementations tailored to their specific requirements.
- `custom_handler` (Attributes) Specifies a user-defined hook or procedure that is called to perform the specific lifecycle action. It offers a flexible and expandable approach for customizing the behavior of a Component by leveraging tailored actions. An Action can be implemented as either an ExecAction or an HTTPAction, with future versions planning to support GRPCAction, thereby accommodating unique logic for different database systems within the Action's framework. In future iterations, all built-in handlers are expected to transition to GRPCAction. This change means that Lorry or other sidecar agents will expose the implementation of actions through a GRPC interface for external invocation. Then the controller will interact with these actions via GRPCAction calls. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--member_leave--custom_handler))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--member_leave--custom_handler"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.lifecycle_actions.member_leave.custom_handler`

Optional:

- `container` (String) Defines the name of the container within the target Pod where the action will be executed. This name must correspond to one of the containers defined in 'componentDefinition.spec.runtime'. If this field is not specified, the default behavior is to use the first container listed in 'componentDefinition.spec.runtime'. This field cannot be updated. Note: This field is reserved for future use and is not currently active.
- `env` (Attributes List) Represents a list of environment variables that will be injected into the container. These variables enable the container to adapt its behavior based on the environment it's running in. This field cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--member_leave--custom_handler--env))
- `exec` (Attributes) Defines the command to run. This field cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--member_leave--custom_handler--exec))
- `http` (Attributes) Specifies the HTTP request to perform. This field cannot be updated. Note: HTTPAction is to be implemented in future version. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--member_leave--custom_handler--http))
- `image` (String) Specifies the container image to be used for running the Action. When specified, a dedicated container will be created using this image to execute the Action. This field is mutually exclusive with the 'container' field; only one of them should be provided. This field cannot be updated.
- `matching_key` (String) Used in conjunction with the 'targetPodSelector' field to refine the selection of target pod(s) for Action execution. The impact of this field depends on the 'targetPodSelector' value: - When 'targetPodSelector' is set to 'Any' or 'All', this field will be ignored. - When 'targetPodSelector' is set to 'Role', only those replicas whose role matches the 'matchingKey' will be selected for the Action. This field cannot be updated. Note: This field is reserved for future use and is not currently active.
- `pre_condition` (String) Specifies the state that the cluster must reach before the Action is executed. Currently, this is only applicable to the 'postProvision' action. The conditions are as follows: - 'Immediately': Executed right after the Component object is created. The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage. - 'RuntimeReady': The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state. - 'ComponentReady': The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state. This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster. - 'ClusterReady': The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state. This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness. This field cannot be updated.
- `retry_policy` (Attributes) Defines the strategy to be taken when retrying the Action after a failure. It specifies the conditions under which the Action should be retried and the limits to apply, such as the maximum number of retries and backoff strategy. This field cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--member_leave--custom_handler--retry_policy))
- `target_pod_selector` (String) Defines the criteria used to select the target Pod(s) for executing the Action. This is useful when there is no default target replica identified. It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in. This field cannot be updated. Note: This field is reserved for future use and is not currently active.
- `timeout_seconds` (Number) Specifies the maximum duration in seconds that the Action is allowed to run. If the Action does not complete within this time frame, it will be terminated. This field cannot be updated.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--pre_terminate"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.lifecycle_actions.pre_terminate`

Optional:

- `builtin_handler` (String) Specifies the name of the predefined action handler to be invoked for lifecycle actions. Lorry, as a sidecar agent co-located with the database container in the same Pod, includes a suite of built-in action implementations that are tailored to different database engines. These are known as 'builtin' handlers, includes: 'mysql', 'redis', 'mongodb', 'etcd', 'postgresql', 'official-postgresql', 'apecloud-postgresql', 'wesql', 'oceanbase', 'polardbx'. If the 'builtinHandler' field is specified, it instructs Lorry to utilize its internal built-in action handler to execute the specified lifecycle actions. The 'builtinHandler' field is of type 'BuiltinActionHandlerType', which represents the name of the built-in handler. The 'builtinHandler' specified within the same 'ComponentLifecycleActions' should be consistent across all actions. This means that if you specify a built-in handler for one action, you should use the same handler for all other actions throughout the entire 'ComponentLifecycleActions' collection. If you need to define lifecycle actions for database engines not covered by the existing built-in support, or when the pre-existing built-in handlers do not meet your specific needs, you can use the 'customHandler' field to define your own action implementation. Deprecation Notice: - In the future, the 'builtinHandler' field will be deprecated in favor of using the 'customHandler' field for configuring all lifecycle actions. - Instead of using a name to indicate the built-in action implementations in Lorry, the recommended approach will be to explicitly invoke the desired action implementation through a gRPC interface exposed by the sidecar agent. - Developers will have the flexibility to either use the built-in action implementations provided by Lorry or develop their own sidecar agent to implement custom actions and expose them via gRPC interfaces. - This change will allow for greater customization and extensibility of lifecycle actions, as developers can create their own 'builtin' implementations tailored to their specific requirements.
- `custom_handler` (Attributes) Specifies a user-defined hook or procedure that is called to perform the specific lifecycle action. It offers a flexible and expandable approach for customizing the behavior of a Component by leveraging tailored actions. An Action can be implemented as either an ExecAction or an HTTPAction, with future versions planning to support GRPCAction, thereby accommodating unique logic for different database systems within the Action's framework. In future iterations, all built-in handlers are expected to transition to GRPCAction. This change means that Lorry or other sidecar agents will expose the implementation of actions through a GRPC interface for external invocation. Then the controller will interact with these actions via GRPCAction calls. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--pre_terminate--custom_handler))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--pre_terminate--custom_handler"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.lifecycle_actions.pre_terminate.custom_handler`

Optional:

- `container` (String) Defines the name of the container within the target Pod where the action will be executed. This name must correspond to one of the containers defined in 'componentDefinition.spec.runtime'. If this field is not specified, the default behavior is to use the first container listed in 'componentDefinition.spec.runtime'. This field cannot be updated. Note: This field is reserved for future use and is not currently active.
- `env` (Attributes List) Represents a list of environment variables that will be injected into the container. These variables enable the container to adapt its behavior based on the environment it's running in. This field cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--pre_terminate--custom_handler--env))
- `exec` (Attributes) Defines the command to run. This field cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--pre_terminate--custom_handler--exec))
- `http` (Attributes) Specifies the HTTP request to perform. This field cannot be updated. Note: HTTPAction is to be implemented in future version. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--pre_terminate--custom_handler--http))
- `image` (String) Specifies the container image to be used for running the Action. When specified, a dedicated container will be created using this image to execute the Action. This field is mutually exclusive with the 'container' field; only one of them should be provided. This field cannot be updated.
- `matching_key` (String) Used in conjunction with the 'targetPodSelector' field to refine the selection of target pod(s) for Action execution. The impact of this field depends on the 'targetPodSelector' value: - When 'targetPodSelector' is set to 'Any' or 'All', this field will be ignored. - When 'targetPodSelector' is set to 'Role', only those replicas whose role matches the 'matchingKey' will be selected for the Action. This field cannot be updated. Note: This field is reserved for future use and is not currently active.
- `pre_condition` (String) Specifies the state that the cluster must reach before the Action is executed. Currently, this is only applicable to the 'postProvision' action. The conditions are as follows: - 'Immediately': Executed right after the Component object is created. The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage. - 'RuntimeReady': The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state. - 'ComponentReady': The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state. This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster. - 'ClusterReady': The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state. This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness. This field cannot be updated.
- `retry_policy` (Attributes) Defines the strategy to be taken when retrying the Action after a failure. It specifies the conditions under which the Action should be retried and the limits to apply, such as the maximum number of retries and backoff strategy. This field cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--pre_terminate--custom_handler--retry_policy))
- `target_pod_selector` (String) Defines the criteria used to select the target Pod(s) for executing the Action. This is useful when there is no default target replica identified. It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in. This field cannot be updated. Note: This field is reserved for future use and is not currently active.
- `timeout_seconds` (Number) Specifies the maximum duration in seconds that the Action is allowed to run. If the Action does not complete within this time frame, it will be terminated. This field cannot be updated.

### Nested Schema for `spec.lifecycle_actions.readwrite`

Optional:

- `builtin_handler` (String) Specifies the name of the predefined action handler to be invoked for lifecycle actions. Lorry, as a sidecar agent co-located with the database container in the same Pod, includes a suite of built-in action implementations that are tailored to different database engines. These are known as 'builtin' handlers, includes: 'mysql', 'redis', 'mongodb', 'etcd', 'postgresql', 'official-postgresql', 'apecloud-postgresql', 'wesql', 'oceanbase', 'polardbx'. If the 'builtinHandler' field is specified, it instructs Lorry to utilize its internal built-in action handler to execute the specified lifecycle actions. The 'builtinHandler' field is of type 'BuiltinActionHandlerType', which represents the name of the built-in handler. The 'builtinHandler' specified within the same 'ComponentLifecycleActions' should be consistent across all actions. This means that if you specify a built-in handler for one action, you should use the same handler for all other actions throughout the entire 'ComponentLifecycleActions' collection. If you need to define lifecycle actions for database engines not covered by the existing built-in support, or when the pre-existing built-in handlers do not meet your specific needs, you can use the 'customHandler' field to define your own action implementation. Deprecation Notice: - In the future, the 'builtinHandler' field will be deprecated in favor of using the 'customHandler' field for configuring all lifecycle actions. - Instead of using a name to indicate the built-in action implementations in Lorry, the recommended approach will be to explicitly invoke the desired action implementation through a gRPC interface exposed by the sidecar agent. - Developers will have the flexibility to either use the built-in action implementations provided by Lorry or develop their own sidecar agent to implement custom actions and expose them via gRPC interfaces. - This change will allow for greater customization and extensibility of lifecycle actions, as developers can create their own 'builtin' implementations tailored to their specific requirements.
- `custom_handler` (Attributes) Specifies a user-defined hook or procedure that is called to perform the specific lifecycle action. It offers a flexible and expandable approach for customizing the behavior of a Component by leveraging tailored actions. An Action can be implemented as either an ExecAction or an HTTPAction, with future versions planning to support GRPCAction, thereby accommodating unique logic for different database systems within the Action's framework. In future iterations, all built-in handlers are expected to transition to GRPCAction. This change means that Lorry or other sidecar agents will expose the implementation of actions through a GRPC interface for external invocation. Then the controller will interact with these actions via GRPCAction calls. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--readwrite--custom_handler))

### Nested Schema for `spec.lifecycle_actions.readwrite.custom_handler`

Optional:

- `container` (String) Defines the name of the container within the target Pod where the action will be executed. This name must correspond to one of the containers defined in 'componentDefinition.spec.runtime'. If this field is not specified, the default behavior is to use the first container listed in 'componentDefinition.spec.runtime'. This field cannot be updated. Note: This field is reserved for future use and is not currently active.
- `env` (Attributes List) Represents a list of environment variables that will be injected into the container. These variables enable the container to adapt its behavior based on the environment it's running in. This field cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--readwrite--custom_handler--env))
- `exec` (Attributes) Defines the command to run. This field cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--readwrite--custom_handler--exec))

- `image` (String) Specifies the container image to be used for running the Action. When specified, a dedicated container will be created using this image to execute the Action. This field is mutually exclusive with the 'container' field; only one of them should be provided. This field cannot be updated.
- `matching_key` (String) Used in conjunction with the 'targetPodSelector' field to refine the selection of target pod(s) for Action execution. The impact of this field depends on the 'targetPodSelector' value: - When 'targetPodSelector' is set to 'Any' or 'All', this field will be ignored. - When 'targetPodSelector' is set to 'Role', only those replicas whose role matches the 'matchingKey' will be selected for the Action. This field cannot be updated. Note: This field is reserved for future use and is not currently active.
- `pre_condition` (String) Specifies the state that the cluster must reach before the Action is executed. Currently, this is only applicable to the 'postProvision' action. The conditions are as follows: - 'Immediately': Executed right after the Component object is created. The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage. - 'RuntimeReady': The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state. - 'ComponentReady': The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state. This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster. - 'ClusterReady': The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state. This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness. This field cannot be updated.
- `retry_policy` (Attributes) Defines the strategy to be taken when retrying the Action after a failure. It specifies the conditions under which the Action should be retried and the limits to apply, such as the maximum number of retries and backoff strategy. This field cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--lifecycle_actions--readwrite--custom_handler--retry_policy))
- `target_pod_selector` (String) Defines the criteria used to select the target Pod(s) for executing the Action. This is useful when there is no default target replica identified. It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in. This field cannot be updated. Note: This field is reserved for future use and is not currently active.
- `timeout_seconds` (Number) Specifies the maximum duration in seconds that the Action is allowed to run. If the Action does not complete within this time frame, it will be terminated. This field cannot be updated.

Required:

- `name` (String) Specifies the name of the configuration template.

Optional:

- `default_mode` (Number) The operator attempts to set default file permissions for scripts (0555) and configurations (0444). However, certain database engines may require different file permissions. You can specify the desired file permissions here. Must be specified as an octal value between 0000 and 0777 (inclusive), or as a decimal value between 0 and 511 (inclusive). YAML supports both octal and decimal values for file permissions. Please note that this setting only affects the permissions of the files themselves. Directories within the specified path are not impacted by this setting. It's important to be aware that this setting might conflict with other options that influence the file mode, such as fsGroup. In such cases, the resulting file mode may have additional bits set. Refers to documents of k8s.ConfigMapVolumeSource.defaultMode for more information.
- `namespace` (String) Specifies the namespace of the referenced configuration template ConfigMap object. An empty namespace is equivalent to the 'default' namespace.
- `template_ref` (String) Specifies the name of the referenced configuration template ConfigMap object.
- `volume_name` (String) Refers to the volume name of PodTemplate. The configuration file produced through the configuration template will be mounted to the corresponding volume. Must be a DNS_LABEL name. The volume name must be defined in podSpec.containers[*].volumeMounts.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--service_ref_declarations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.service_ref_declarations`

Required:

- `name` (String) Specifies the name of the ServiceRefDeclaration.
- `service_ref_declaration_specs` (Attributes List) Defines a list of constraints and requirements for services that can be bound to this ServiceRefDeclaration upon Cluster creation. Each ServiceRefDeclarationSpec defines a ServiceKind and ServiceVersion, outlining the acceptable service types and versions that are compatible. This flexibility allows a ServiceRefDeclaration to be fulfilled by any one of the provided specs. For example, if it requires an OLTP database, specs for both MySQL and PostgreSQL are listed, either MySQL or PostgreSQL services can be used when binding. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--service_ref_declarations--service_ref_declaration_specs))

Optional:

- `optional` (Boolean) Specifies whether the service reference can be optional. For an optional service-ref, the component can still be created even if the service-ref is not provided.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--service_ref_declarations--service_ref_declaration_specs"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.service_ref_declarations.service_ref_declaration_specs`

Required:

- `service_kind` (String) Specifies the type or nature of the service. This should be a well-known application cluster type, such as {mysql, redis, mongodb}. The field is case-insensitive and supports abbreviations for some well-known databases. For instance, both 'zk' and 'zookeeper' are considered as a ZooKeeper cluster, while 'pg', 'postgres', 'postgresql' are all recognized as a PostgreSQL cluster.
- `service_version` (String) Defines the service version of the service reference. This is a regular expression that matches a version number pattern. For instance, '^8.0.8$', '8.0.d{1,2}$', '^[v-]*?(d{1,2}.){0,3}d{1,2}$' are all valid patterns.



<a id="nestedatt--spec--services"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.services`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name defines the name of the service. otherwise, it indicates the name of the service. Others can refer to this service by its name. (e.g., connection credential) Cannot be updated.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) If ServiceType is LoadBalancer, cloud provider related parameters can be put here More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer.
- `disable_auto_provision` (Boolean) Indicates whether the automatic provisioning of the service should be disabled. If set to true, the service will not be automatically created at the component provisioning. Instead, you can enable the creation of this service by specifying it explicitly in the cluster API.
- `pod_service` (Boolean) Indicates whether to create a corresponding Service for each Pod of the selected Component. When set to true, a set of Services will be automatically generated for each Pod, and the 'roleSelector' field will be ignored. The names of the generated Services will follow the same suffix naming pattern: '$(serviceName)-$(podOrdinal)'. The total number of generated Services will be equal to the number of replicas specified for the Component. Example usage: '''yaml name: my-service serviceName: my-service podService: true disableAutoProvision: true spec: type: NodePort ports: - name: http port: 80 targetPort: 8080 ''' In this example, if the Component has 3 replicas, three Services will be generated: - my-service-0: Points to the first Pod (podOrdinal: 0) - my-service-1: Points to the second Pod (podOrdinal: 1) - my-service-2: Points to the third Pod (podOrdinal: 2) Each generated Service will have the specified spec configuration and will target its respective Pod. This feature is useful when you need to expose each Pod of a Component individually, allowing external access to specific instances of the Component.
- `role_selector` (String) Extends the above 'serviceSpec.selector' by allowing you to specify defined role as selector for the service. When 'roleSelector' is set, it adds a label selector 'kubeblocks.io/role: {roleSelector}' to the 'serviceSpec.selector'. Example usage: roleSelector: 'leader' In this example, setting 'roleSelector' to 'leader' will add a label selector 'kubeblocks.io/role: leader' to the 'serviceSpec.selector'. This means that the service will select and route traffic to Pods with the label 'kubeblocks.io/role' set to 'leader'. Note that if 'podService' sets to true, RoleSelector will be ignored. The 'podService' flag takes precedence over 'roleSelector' and generates a service for each Pod.
- `service_name` (String) ServiceName defines the name of the underlying service object. If not specified, the default service name with different patterns will be used: - CLUSTER_NAME: for cluster-level services - CLUSTER_NAME-COMPONENT_NAME: for component-level services Only one default service name is allowed. Cannot be updated.
- `spec` (Attributes) Spec defines the behavior of a service. https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--services--spec))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--services--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.services.spec`

Optional:

- `allocate_load_balancer_node_ports` (Boolean) allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts defines if NodePorts will be automatically allocated for services with type LoadBalancer. Default is 'true'. It may be set to 'false' if the cluster load-balancer does not rely on NodePorts. If the caller requests specific NodePorts (by specifying a value), those requests will be respected, regardless of this field. This field may only be set for services with type LoadBalancer and will be cleared if the type is changed to any other type.
- `cluster_i_ps` (List of String) ClusterIPs is a list of IP addresses assigned to this service, and are usually assigned randomly. If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as per system configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to the service; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field may not be changed through updates unless the type field is also being changed to ExternalName (which requires this field to be empty) or the type field is being changed from ExternalName (in which case this field may optionally be specified, as describe above). Valid values are 'None', empty string (''), or a valid IP address. Setting this to 'None' makes a 'headless service' (no virtual IP), which is useful when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying is not required. Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specified when creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName. If this field is not specified, it will be initialized from the clusterIP field. If this field is specified, clients must ensure that clusterIPs[0] and clusterIP have the same value. This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack IPs, in either order). These IPs must correspond to the values of the ipFamilies field. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `cluster_ip` (String) clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assigned randomly. If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as per system configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to the service; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field may not be changed through updates unless the type field is also being changed to ExternalName (which requires this field to be blank) or the type field is being changed from ExternalName (in which case this field may optionally be specified, as describe above). Valid values are 'None', empty string (''), or a valid IP address. Setting this to 'None' makes a 'headless service' (no virtual IP), which is useful when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying is not required. Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specified when creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `external_i_ps` (List of String) externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will also accept traffic for this service. These IPs are not managed by Kubernetes. The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP. A common example is external load-balancers that are not part of the Kubernetes system.
- `external_name` (String) externalName is the external reference that discovery mechanisms will return as an alias for this service (e.g. a DNS CNAME record). No proxying will be involved. Must be a lowercase RFC-1123 hostname (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires 'type' to be 'ExternalName'.
- `external_traffic_policy` (String) externalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they receive on one of the Service's 'externally-facing' addresses (NodePorts, ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to 'Local', the proxy will configure the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, 'Cluster', uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get 'Cluster' semantics, but clients sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when picking a node.
- `health_check_node_port` (Number) healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service. This only applies when type is set to LoadBalancer and externalTrafficPolicy is set to Local. If a value is specified, is in-range, and is not in use, it will be used. If not specified, a value will be automatically allocated. External systems (e.g. load-balancers) can use this port to determine if a given node holds endpoints for this service or not. If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type). This field cannot be updated once set.
- `internal_traffic_policy` (String) InternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they receive on the ClusterIP. If set to 'Local', the proxy will assume that pods only want to talk to endpoints of the service on the same node as the pod, dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value, 'Cluster', uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features).
- `ip_families` (List of String) IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to this service. This field is usually assigned automatically based on cluster configuration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If this field is specified manually, the requested family is available in the cluster, and ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field is conditionally mutable: it allows for adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not allow changing the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are 'IPv4' and 'IPv6'. This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to 'headless' services. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName. This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, in either order). These families must correspond to the values of the clusterIPs field, if specified. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.
- `ip_family_policy` (String) IPFamilyPolicy represents the dual-stack-ness requested or required by this Service. If there is no value provided, then this field will be set to SingleStack. Services can be 'SingleStack' (a single IP family), 'PreferDualStack' (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters or a single IP family on single-stack clusters), or 'RequireDualStack' (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters, otherwise fail). The ipFamilies and clusterIPs fields depend on the value of this field. This field will be wiped when updating a service to type ExternalName.
- `load_balancer_class` (String) loadBalancerClass is the class of the load balancer implementation this Service belongs to. If specified, the value of this field must be a label-style identifier, with an optional prefix, e.g. 'internal-vip' or 'example.com/internal-vip'. Unprefixed names are reserved for end-users. This field can only be set when the Service type is 'LoadBalancer'. If not set, the default load balancer implementation is used, today this is typically done through the cloud provider integration, but should apply for any default implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancer implementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancer implementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field. This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type 'LoadBalancer'. Once set, it can not be changed. This field will be wiped when a service is updated to a non 'LoadBalancer' type.
- `load_balancer_ip` (String) Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer. This feature depends on whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifying the loadBalancerIP when a load balancer is created. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature. Deprecated: This field was under-specified and its meaning varies across implementations. Using it is non-portable and it may not support dual-stack. Users are encouraged to use implementation-specific annotations when available.
- `load_balancer_source_ranges` (List of String) If specified and supported by the platform, this will restrict traffic through the cloud-provider load-balancer will be restricted to the specified client IPs. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.' More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/
- `ports` (Attributes List) The list of ports that are exposed by this service. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--services--spec--ports))
- `publish_not_ready_addresses` (Boolean) publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints for this Service should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready. The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery. The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered 'ready' even if the Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.
- `selector` (Map of String) Route service traffic to pods with label keys and values matching this selector. If empty or not present, the service is assumed to have an external process managing its endpoints, which Kubernetes will not modify. Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Ignored if type is ExternalName. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/
- `session_affinity` (String) Supports 'ClientIP' and 'None'. Used to maintain session affinity. Enable client IP based session affinity. Must be ClientIP or None. Defaults to None. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `session_affinity_config` (Attributes) sessionAffinityConfig contains the configurations of session affinity. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--services--spec--session_affinity_config))
- `type` (String) type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. 'ClusterIP' allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is 'None', no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather than a virtual IP. 'NodePort' builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. 'LoadBalancer' builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. 'ExternalName' aliases this service to the specified externalName. Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types

- `port` (Number) The port that will be exposed by this service.

Optional:

- `app_protocol` (String) The application protocol for this port. This is used as a hint for implementations to offer richer behavior for protocols that they understand. This field follows standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are either: * Un-prefixed protocol names - reserved for IANA standard service names (as per RFC-6335 and https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names). * Kubernetes-defined prefixed names: * 'kubernetes.io/h2c' - HTTP/2 prior knowledge over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html#name-starting-http-2-with-prior- * 'kubernetes.io/ws' - WebSocket over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455 * 'kubernetes.io/wss' - WebSocket over TLS as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455 * Other protocols should use implementation-defined prefixed names such as mycompany.com/my-custom-protocol.
- `name` (String) The name of this port within the service. This must be a DNS_LABEL. All ports within a ServiceSpec must have unique names. When considering the endpoints for a Service, this must match the 'name' field in the EndpointPort. Optional if only one ServicePort is defined on this service.
- `node_port` (Number) The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type is NodePort or LoadBalancer. Usually assigned by the system. If a value is specified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise the operation will fail. If not specified, a port will be allocated if this Service requires one. If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type from NodePort to ClusterIP). More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport
- `protocol` (String) The IP protocol for this port. Supports 'TCP', 'UDP', and 'SCTP'. Default is TCP.
- `target_port` (String) Number or name of the port to access on the pods targeted by the service. Number must be in the range 1 to 65535. Name must be an IANA_SVC_NAME. If this is a string, it will be looked up as a named port in the target Pod's container ports. If this is not specified, the value of the 'port' field is used (an identity map). This field is ignored for services with clusterIP=None, and should be omitted or set equal to the 'port' field. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#defining-a-service

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the variable. Must be a C_IDENTIFIER.

Optional:

- `expression` (String) A Go template expression that will be applied to the resolved value of the var. The expression will only be evaluated if the var is successfully resolved to a non-credential value. The resolved value can be accessed by its name within the expression, system vars and other user-defined non-credential vars can be used within the expression in the same way. Notice that, when accessing vars by its name, you should replace all the '-' in the name with '_', because of that '-' is not a valid identifier in Go. All expressions are evaluated in the order the vars are defined. If a var depends on any vars that also have expressions defined, be careful about the evaluation order as it may use intermediate values. The result of evaluation will be used as the final value of the var. If the expression fails to evaluate, the resolving of var will also be considered failed.
- `value` (String) Variable references '$(VAR_NAME)' are expanded using the previously defined variables in the current context. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double '$$' are reduced to a single '$', which allows for escaping the '$(VAR_NAME)' syntax: i.e. - '$$(VAR_NAME)' will produce the string literal '$(VAR_NAME)'. Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Defaults to ''.
- `value_from` (Attributes) Source for the variable's value. Cannot be used if value is not empty. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--vars--value_from))
