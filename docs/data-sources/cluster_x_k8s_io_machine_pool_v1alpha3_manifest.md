- `namespace` (String) Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace isequivalent to the 'default' namespace, but 'default' is the canonical representation.Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field forthose objects will be empty.Must be a DNS_LABEL.Cannot be updated.More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespacesDeprecated: This field has no function and is going to be removed in a next release.
- `owner_references` (Attributes List) List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list havebeen deleted, this object will be garbage collected.

### Nested Schema for `spec.template.metadata.owner_references`

Required:

- `api_version` (String) API version of the referent.

Optional:

- `block_owner_deletion` (Boolean) If true, AND if the owner has the 'foregroundDeletion' finalizer, thenthe owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until thisreference is removed.See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/garbage-collection/#foreground-deletionfor how the garbage collector interacts with this field and enforces the foreground deletion.Defaults to false.To set this field, a user needs 'delete' permission of the owner,otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.
- `controller` (Boolean) If true, this reference points to the managing controller.



<a id="nestedatt--spec--template--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.template.spec`

Required:

- `bootstrap` (Attributes) Bootstrap is a reference to a local struct which encapsulatesfields to configure the Machineâ€™s bootstrapping mechanism. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--template--spec--bootstrap))
- `cluster_name` (String) ClusterName is the name of the Cluster this object belongs to.
- `infrastructure_ref` (Attributes) InfrastructureRef is a required reference to a custom resourceoffered by an infrastructure provider. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--template--spec--infrastructure_ref))

Optional:

- `failure_domain` (String) FailureDomain is the failure domain the machine will be created in.Must match a key in the FailureDomains map stored on the cluster object.
- `node_drain_timeout` (String) NodeDrainTimeout is the total amount of time that the controller will spend on draining a node.The default value is 0, meaning that the node can be drained without any time limitations.NOTE: NodeDrainTimeout is different from 'kubectl drain --timeout'
- `provider_id` (String) ProviderID is the identification ID of the machine provided by the provider.This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine.This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscalerwith cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find outmachines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as ageneric out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to beable to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserverand then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that willbe interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.
- `version` (String) Version defines the desired Kubernetes version.This field is meant to be optionally used by bootstrap providers.

### Nested Schema for `spec.template.spec.bootstrap`

Optional:

- `config_ref` (Attributes) ConfigRef is a reference to a bootstrap provider-specific resourcethat holds configuration details.

- `data` (String) Data contains the bootstrap data, such as cloud-init details scripts.If nil, the Machine should remain in the Pending state.Deprecated: Switch to DataSecretName.

This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way ofreferencing a part of an object.TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--strategy--rolling_update"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.strategy.rolling_update`

Optional:

- `max_surge` (String) The maximum number of machines that can be scheduled above thedesired number of machines.Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage ofdesired machines (ex: 10%).This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.Defaults to 1.Example: when this is set to 30%, the new MachineSet can be scaledup immediately when the rolling update starts, such that the totalnumber of old and new machines do not exceed 130% of desiredmachines. Once old machines have been killed, new MachineSet canbe scaled up further, ensuring that total number of machines runningat any time during the update is at most 130% of desired machines.
- `max_unavailable` (String) The maximum number of machines that can be unavailable during the update.Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desiredmachines (ex: 10%).Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0.Defaults to 0.Example: when this is set to 30%, the old MachineSet can be scaleddown to 70% of desired machines immediately when the rolling updatestarts. Once new machines are ready, old MachineSet can be scaleddown further, followed by scaling up the new MachineSet, ensuringthat the total number of machines available at all timesduring the update is at least 70% of desired machines.
