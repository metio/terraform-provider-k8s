<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `delete_policy` (String) DeletePolicy defines the policy used to identify nodes to delete when downscaling. Defaults to 'Random'.  Valid values are 'Random, 'Newest', 'Oldest'

- `selector` (Attributes) Selector is a label query over machines that should match the replica count. Label keys and values that must match in order to be controlled by this MachineSet. It must match the machine template's labels. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--selector))
- `template` (Attributes) Template is the object that describes the machine that will be created if insufficient replicas are detected. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--template))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--selector"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.selector`

Optional:

- `match_expressions` (Attributes List) matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--selector--match_expressions))
- `match_labels` (Map of String) matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.

### Nested Schema for `spec.template.metadata`

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
- `generate_name` (String) GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.  If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).  Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency
- `labels` (Map of String) Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
- `name` (String) Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
- `namespace` (String) Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the 'default' namespace, but 'default' is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.  Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
- `owner_references` (Attributes List) List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--template--metadata--owner_references))

- `uid` (String) UID of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#uids

Optional:

- `block_owner_deletion` (Boolean) If true, AND if the owner has the 'foregroundDeletion' finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/garbage-collection/#foreground-deletion for how the garbage collector interacts with this field and enforces the foreground deletion. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs 'delete' permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.
- `controller` (Boolean) If true, this reference points to the managing controller.



<a id="nestedatt--spec--template--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.template.spec`

Optional:

- `lifecycle_hooks` (Attributes) LifecycleHooks allow users to pause operations on the machine at certain predefined points within the machine lifecycle. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--template--spec--lifecycle_hooks))
- `metadata` (Attributes) ObjectMeta will autopopulate the Node created. Use this to indicate what labels, annotations, name prefix, etc., should be used when creating the Node. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--template--spec--metadata))
- `provider_id` (String) ProviderID is the identification ID of the machine provided by the provider. This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine. This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete. This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.
- `provider_spec` (Attributes) ProviderSpec details Provider-specific configuration to use during node creation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--template--spec--provider_spec))
- `taints` (Attributes List) The list of the taints to be applied to the corresponding Node in additive manner. This list will not overwrite any other taints added to the Node on an ongoing basis by other entities. These taints should be actively reconciled e.g. if you ask the machine controller to apply a taint and then manually remove the taint the machine controller will put it back) but not have the machine controller remove any taints (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--template--spec--taints))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--template--spec--lifecycle_hooks"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.template.spec.taints`

Optional:

- `pre_drain` (Attributes List) PreDrain hooks prevent the machine from being drained. This also blocks further lifecycle events, such as termination. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--template--spec--taints--pre_drain))
- `pre_terminate` (Attributes List) PreTerminate hooks prevent the machine from being terminated. PreTerminate hooks be actioned after the Machine has been drained. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--template--spec--taints--pre_terminate))

### Nested Schema for `spec.template.spec.taints.pre_drain`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name defines a unique name for the lifcycle hook. The name should be unique and descriptive, ideally 1-3 words, in CamelCase or it may be namespaced, eg. foo.example.com/CamelCase. Names must be unique and should only be managed by a single entity.
- `owner` (String) Owner defines the owner of the lifecycle hook. This should be descriptive enough so that users can identify who/what is responsible for blocking the lifecycle. This could be the name of a controller (e.g. clusteroperator/etcd) or an administrator managing the hook.
