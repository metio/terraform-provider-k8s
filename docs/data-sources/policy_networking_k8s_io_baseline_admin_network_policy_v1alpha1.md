  metadata = {
    name = "some-name"

  }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) The API group of the requested resource.
- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.name`.
- `kind` (String) The type of the requested resource.
- `spec` (Attributes) Specification of the desired behavior of BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Read-Only:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Read-Only:

- `egress` (Attributes List) Egress is the list of Egress rules to be applied to the selected pods if they are not matched by any AdminNetworkPolicy or NetworkPolicy rules. A total of 100 Egress rules will be allowed in each BANP instance. The relative precedence of egress rules within a single BANP object will be determined by the order in which the rule is written. Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the egress rules would take the highest precedence. BANPs with no egress rules do not affect egress traffic. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress))
- `ingress` (Attributes List) Ingress is the list of Ingress rules to be applied to the selected pods if they are not matched by any AdminNetworkPolicy or NetworkPolicy rules. A total of 100 Ingress rules will be allowed in each BANP instance. The relative precedence of ingress rules within a single BANP object will be determined by the order in which the rule is written. Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the ingress rules would take the highest precedence. BANPs with no ingress rules do not affect ingress traffic. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--ingress))

- `to` (Attributes List) To is the list of destinations whose traffic this rule applies to. If any AdminNetworkPolicyPeer matches the destination of outgoing traffic then the specified action is applied. This field must be defined and contain at least one item.
