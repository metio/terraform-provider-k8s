# k8s_policy_networking_k8s_io_admin_network_policy_v1alpha1_manifest (Data Source)

AdminNetworkPolicy is  a cluster level resource that is part of theAdminNetworkPolicy API.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_policy_networking_k8s_io_admin_network_policy_v1alpha1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name = "some-name"

  }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) Specification of the desired behavior of AdminNetworkPolicy. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `priority` (Number) Priority is a value from 0 to 1000. Rules with lower priority values havehigher precedence, and are checked before rules with higher priority values.All AdminNetworkPolicy rules have higher precedence than NetworkPolicy orBaselineAdminNetworkPolicy rulesThe behavior is undefined if two ANP objects have same priority.Support: Core
- `subject` (Attributes) Subject defines the pods to which this AdminNetworkPolicy applies.Note that host-networked pods are not included in subject selection.Support: Core (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--subject))

Optional:

- `egress` (Attributes List) Egress is the list of Egress rules to be applied to the selected pods.A total of 100 rules will be allowed in each ANP instance.The relative precedence of egress rules within a single ANP object (all ofwhich share the priority) will be determined by the order in which the ruleis written. Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the egress ruleswould take the highest precedence.ANPs with no egress rules do not affect egress traffic.Support: Core (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress))
- `ingress` (Attributes List) Ingress is the list of Ingress rules to be applied to the selected pods.A total of 100 rules will be allowed in each ANP instance.The relative precedence of ingress rules within a single ANP object (all ofwhich share the priority) will be determined by the order in which the ruleis written. Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the ingress ruleswould take the highest precedence.ANPs with no ingress rules do not affect ingress traffic.Support: Core (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--ingress))
