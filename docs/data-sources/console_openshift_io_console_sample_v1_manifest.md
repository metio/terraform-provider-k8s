## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) spec contains configuration for a console sample. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

- `description` (String) description is a long form explanation of the sample.  It is required and can have a maximum length of **4096** characters.  It is a README.md-like content for additional information, links, pre-conditions, and other instructions. It will be rendered as Markdown so that it can contain line breaks, links, and other simple formatting.
- `source` (Attributes) source defines where to deploy the sample service from. The sample may be sourced from an external git repository or container image. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--source))
- `title` (String) title is the display name of the sample.  It is required and must be no more than 50 characters in length.

Optional:

- `icon` (String) icon is an optional base64 encoded image and shown beside the sample title.

Vector images can also be used. SVG icons must start with:  data:image/svg+xml;base64,     plus the base64 encoded SVG image.  All sample catalog icons will be shown on a white background (also when the dark theme is used). The web console ensures that different aspect ratios work correctly. Currently, the surface of the icon is at most 40x100px.  For more information on the data URL format, please visit https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URLs.

A provider can be a company like 'Red Hat' or an organization like 'CNCF' or 'Knative'.  Currently, the provider is only shown on the sample card tile below the title with the prefix 'Provided by '
- `tags` (List of String) tags are optional string values that can be used to find samples in the samples catalog.  Examples of common tags may be 'Java', 'Quarkus', etc.  They will be displayed on the samples details page.
- `type` (String) type is an optional label to group multiple samples.  It is optional and must be no more than 20 characters in length.  Recommendation is a singular term like 'Builder Image', 'Devfile' or 'Serverless Function'.  Currently, the type is shown a badge on the sample card tile in the top right corner.
