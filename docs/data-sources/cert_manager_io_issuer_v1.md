# k8s_cert_manager_io_issuer_v1 (Data Source)

An Issuer represents a certificate issuing authority which can be referenced as part of 'issuerRef' fields. It is scoped to a single namespace and can therefore only be referenced by resources within the same namespace.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_cert_manager_io_issuer_v1" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"

  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.
- `spec` (Attributes) Desired state of the Issuer resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Read-Only:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Read-Only:

- `acme` (Attributes) ACME configures this issuer to communicate with a RFC8555 (ACME) server to obtain signed x509 certificates. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--acme))
- `ca` (Attributes) CA configures this issuer to sign certificates using a signing CA keypair stored in a Secret resource. This is used to build internal PKIs that are managed by cert-manager. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--ca))
- `self_signed` (Attributes) SelfSigned configures this issuer to 'self sign' certificates using the private key used to create the CertificateRequest object. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--self_signed))
- `vault` (Attributes) Vault configures this issuer to sign certificates using a HashiCorp Vault PKI backend. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--vault))
- `venafi` (Attributes) Venafi configures this issuer to sign certificates using a Venafi TPP or Venafi Cloud policy zone. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--venafi))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--acme"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.acme`

Read-Only:

- `ca_bundle` (String) Base64-encoded bundle of PEM CAs which can be used to validate the certificate chain presented by the ACME server. Mutually exclusive with SkipTLSVerify; prefer using CABundle to prevent various kinds of security vulnerabilities. If CABundle and SkipTLSVerify are unset, the system certificate bundle inside the container is used to validate the TLS connection.
- `disable_account_key_generation` (Boolean) Enables or disables generating a new ACME account key. If true, the Issuer resource will *not* request a new account but will expect the account key to be supplied via an existing secret. If false, the cert-manager system will generate a new ACME account key for the Issuer. Defaults to false.
- `email` (String) Email is the email address to be associated with the ACME account. This field is optional, but it is strongly recommended to be set. It will be used to contact you in case of issues with your account or certificates, including expiry notification emails. This field may be updated after the account is initially registered.
- `enable_duration_feature` (Boolean) Enables requesting a Not After date on certificates that matches the duration of the certificate. This is not supported by all ACME servers like Let's Encrypt. If set to true when the ACME server does not support it it will create an error on the Order. Defaults to false.
- `external_account_binding` (Attributes) ExternalAccountBinding is a reference to a CA external account of the ACME server. If set, upon registration cert-manager will attempt to associate the given external account credentials with the registered ACME account. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--acme--external_account_binding))
- `preferred_chain` (String) PreferredChain is the chain to use if the ACME server outputs multiple. PreferredChain is no guarantee that this one gets delivered by the ACME endpoint. For example, for Let's Encrypt's DST crosssign you would use: 'DST Root CA X3' or 'ISRG Root X1' for the newer Let's Encrypt root CA. This value picks the first certificate bundle in the ACME alternative chains that has a certificate with this value as its issuer's CN
- `private_key_secret_ref` (Attributes) PrivateKey is the name of a Kubernetes Secret resource that will be used to store the automatically generated ACME account private key. Optionally, a 'key' may be specified to select a specific entry within the named Secret resource. If 'key' is not specified, a default of 'tls.key' will be used. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--acme--private_key_secret_ref))
- `server` (String) Server is the URL used to access the ACME server's 'directory' endpoint. For example, for Let's Encrypt's staging endpoint, you would use: 'https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory'. Only ACME v2 endpoints (i.e. RFC 8555) are supported.
- `skip_tls_verify` (Boolean) INSECURE: Enables or disables validation of the ACME server TLS certificate. If true, requests to the ACME server will not have the TLS certificate chain validated. Mutually exclusive with CABundle; prefer using CABundle to prevent various kinds of security vulnerabilities. Only enable this option in development environments. If CABundle and SkipTLSVerify are unset, the system certificate bundle inside the container is used to validate the TLS connection. Defaults to false.
- `solvers` (Attributes List) Solvers is a list of challenge solvers that will be used to solve ACME challenges for the matching domains. Solver configurations must be provided in order to obtain certificates from an ACME server. For more information, see: https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/ (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--acme--solvers))

- `key_id` (String) keyID is the ID of the CA key that the External Account is bound to.
- `key_secret_ref` (Attributes) keySecretRef is a Secret Key Selector referencing a data item in a Kubernetes Secret which holds the symmetric MAC key of the External Account Binding. The 'key' is the index string that is paired with the key data in the Secret and should not be confused with the key data itself, or indeed with the External Account Binding keyID above. The secret key stored in the Secret **must** be un-padded, base64 URL encoded data. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--acme--external_account_binding--key_secret_ref))

- `port` (Number) Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted differently based on the type of parent resource.  When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and select this Route). It's not recommended to set 'Port' unless the networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match both specified values.  Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources. Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly document how/if Port is interpreted.  For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.  Support: Extended  <gateway:experimental>
- `section_name` (String) SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:  * Gateway: Listener Name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match both specified values.  Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources. If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is interpreted.  When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource. For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.  Support: Core

The node that is most preferred is the one with the greatest sum of weights, i.e. for each node that meets all of the scheduling requirements (resource request, requiredDuringScheduling anti-affinity expressions, etc.), compute a sum by iterating through the elements of this field and adding 'weight' to the sum if the node has pods which matches the corresponding podAffinityTerm; the node(s) with the highest sum are the most preferred. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--acme--solvers--selector--ingress--service_type--spec--tolerations--pod_anti_affinity--preferred_during_scheduling_ignored_during_execution))
- `required_during_scheduling_ignored_during_execution` (Attributes List) If the anti-affinity requirements specified by this field are not met at scheduling time, the pod will not be scheduled onto the node. If the anti-affinity requirements specified by this field cease to be met at some point during pod execution (e.g. due to a pod label update), the system may or may not try to eventually evict the pod from its node. When there are multiple elements, the lists of nodes corresponding to each podAffinityTerm are intersected, i.e. all terms must be satisfied.
