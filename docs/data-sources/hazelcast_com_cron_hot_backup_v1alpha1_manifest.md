- `failed_hot_backups_history_limit` (Number) The number of failed finished hot backups to retain.
- `successful_hot_backups_history_limit` (Number) The number of successful finished hot backups to retain.
- `suspend` (Boolean) When true, CronHotBackup will stop creating HotBackup CRs until it is disabled
