### Nested Schema for `spec.ingress.extra_rules`

Optional:

- `host` (String) host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986.Note the following deviations from the 'host' part of theURI as defined in RFC 3986:1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to   the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress.2. The ':' delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed.	  Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and	  :443 for https.Both these may change in the future.Incoming requests are matched against the host before theIngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes alltraffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue.host can be 'precise' which is a domain name without the terminating dot ofa network host (e.g. 'foo.bar.com') or 'wildcard', which is a domain nameprefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. '*.foo.com').The wildcard character '*' must appear by itself as the first DNS label andmatches only a single label. You cannot have a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == '*').Requests will be matched against the Host field in the following way:1. If host is precise, the request matches this rule if the http host header is equal to Host.2. If host is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule if the http host headeris to equal to the suffix (removing the first label) of the wildcard rule.
- `http` (Attributes) HTTPIngressRuleValue is a list of http selectors pointing to backends.In the example: http://<host>/<path>?<searchpart> -> backend wherewhere parts of the url correspond to RFC 3986, this resource will be usedto match against everything after the last '/' and before the first '?'or '#'.

- `path_type` (String) pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType canbe one of the following values:* Exact: Matches the URL path exactly.* Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is  done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the  list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a  match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the  request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring  of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar  matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).* ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to  the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType  or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.Implementations are required to support all path types.

Optional:

- `path` (String) path is matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it cancontain characters disallowed from the conventional 'path' part of a URLas defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a '/' and must be presentwhen using PathType with value 'Exact' or 'Prefix'.

Optional:

- `match_expressions` (Attributes List) matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--user_selector--match_expressions))
- `match_labels` (Map of String) matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabelsmap is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', theoperator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.

### Nested Schema for `spec.user_selector.match_expressions`

Required:

- `key` (String) key is the label key that the selector applies to.
- `operator` (String) operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values.Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

Optional:

- `values` (List of String) values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn,the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist,the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategicmerge patch.



<a id="nestedatt--spec--volume_mounts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.volume_mounts`

Required:

- `mount_path` (String) Path within the container at which the volume should be mounted.  Mustnot contain ':'.
- `name` (String) This must match the Name of a Volume.

Optional:

- `mount_propagation` (String) mountPropagation determines how mounts are propagated from the hostto container and the other way around.When not set, MountPropagationNone is used.This field is beta in 1.10.
- `read_only` (Boolean) Mounted read-only if true, read-write otherwise (false or unspecified).Defaults to false.
- `sub_path` (String) Path within the volume from which the container's volume should be mounted.Defaults to '' (volume's root).
- `sub_path_expr` (String) Expanded path within the volume from which the container's volume should be mounted.Behaves similarly to SubPath but environment variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment.Defaults to '' (volume's root).SubPathExpr and SubPath are mutually exclusive.
