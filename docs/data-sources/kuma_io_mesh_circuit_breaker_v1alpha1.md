<a id="nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.from.default.outlier_detection.detectors`

Read-Only:

- `failure_percentage` (Attributes) Failure Percentage based outlier detection functions similarly to success rate detection, in that it relies on success rate data from each host in a cluster. However, rather than compare those values to the mean success rate of the cluster as a whole, they are compared to a flat user-configured threshold. This threshold is configured via the outlierDetection.failurePercentageThreshold field. The other configuration fields for failure percentage based detection are similar to the fields for success rate detection. As with success rate detection, detection will not be performed for a host if its request volume over the aggregation interval is less than the outlierDetection.detectors.failurePercentage.requestVolume value. Detection also will not be performed for a cluster if the number of hosts with the minimum required request volume in an interval is less than the outlierDetection.detectors.failurePercentage.minimumHosts value. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors--failure_percentage))
- `gateway_failures` (Attributes) In the default mode (outlierDetection.splitExternalLocalOriginErrors is false) this detection type takes into account a subset of 5xx errors, called 'gateway errors' (502, 503 or 504 status code) and local origin failures, such as timeout, TCP reset etc. In split mode (outlierDetection.splitExternalLocalOriginErrors is true) this detection type takes into account a subset of 5xx errors, called 'gateway errors' (502, 503 or 504 status code) and is supported only by the http router. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors--gateway_failures))
- `local_origin_failures` (Attributes) This detection type is enabled only when outlierDetection.splitExternalLocalOriginErrors is true and takes into account only locally originated errors (timeout, reset, etc). If Envoy repeatedly cannot connect to an upstream host or communication with the upstream host is repeatedly interrupted, it will be ejected. Various locally originated problems are detected: timeout, TCP reset, ICMP errors, etc. This detection type is supported by http router and tcp proxy. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors--local_origin_failures))
- `success_rate` (Attributes) Success Rate based outlier detection aggregates success rate data from every host in a cluster. Then at given intervals ejects hosts based on statistical outlier detection. Success Rate outlier detection will not be calculated for a host if its request volume over the aggregation interval is less than the outlierDetection.detectors.successRate.requestVolume value. Moreover, detection will not be performed for a cluster if the number of hosts with the minimum required request volume in an interval is less than the outlierDetection.detectors.successRate.minimumHosts value. In the default configuration mode (outlierDetection.splitExternalLocalOriginErrors is false) this detection type takes into account all types of errors: locally and externally originated. In split mode (outlierDetection.splitExternalLocalOriginErrors is true), locally originated errors and externally originated (transaction) errors are counted and treated separately. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors--success_rate))
- `total_failures` (Attributes) In the default mode (outlierDetection.splitExternalAndLocalErrors is false) this detection type takes into account all generated errors: locally originated and externally originated (transaction) errors. In split mode (outlierDetection.splitExternalLocalOriginErrors is true) this detection type takes into account only externally originated (transaction) errors, ignoring locally originated errors. If an upstream host is an HTTP-server, only 5xx types of error are taken into account (see Consecutive Gateway Failure for exceptions). Properly formatted responses, even when they carry an operational error (like index not found, access denied) are not taken into account. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors--total_failures))

### Nested Schema for `spec.from.default.outlier_detection.detectors.total_failures`

Read-Only:

- `minimum_hosts` (Number) The minimum number of hosts in a cluster in order to perform failure percentage-based ejection. If the total number of hosts in the cluster is less than this value, failure percentage-based ejection will not be performed.

If the volume is lower than this setting, failure percentage-based ejection will not be performed for this host.
- `threshold` (Number) The failure percentage to use when determining failure percentage-based outlier detection. If the failure percentage of a given host is greater than or equal to this value, it will be ejected.

- `standard_deviation_factor` (String) This factor is used to determine the ejection threshold for success rate outlier ejection. The ejection threshold is the difference between the mean success rate, and the product of this factor and the standard deviation of the mean success rate: mean - (standard_deviation * success_rate_standard_deviation_factor).
