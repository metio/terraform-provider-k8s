# k8s_autoscaling_karmada_io_federated_hpa_v1alpha1_manifest (Data Source)

FederatedHPA is centralized HPA that can aggregate the metrics in multiple clusters. When the system load increases, it will query the metrics from multiple clusters and scales up the replicas. When the system load decreases, it will query the metrics from multiple clusters and scales down the replicas. After the replicas are scaled up/down, karmada-scheduler will schedule the replicas based on the policy.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_autoscaling_karmada_io_federated_hpa_v1alpha1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) Spec is the specification of the FederatedHPA. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `max_replicas` (Number) MaxReplicas is the upper limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale up. It cannot be less that minReplicas.
- `scale_target_ref` (Attributes) ScaleTargetRef points to the target resource to scale, and is used to the pods for which metrics should be collected, as well as to actually change the replica count. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--scale_target_ref))

Optional:

- `behavior` (Attributes) Behavior configures the scaling behavior of the target in both Up and Down directions (scaleUp and scaleDown fields respectively). If not set, the default HPAScalingRules for scale up and scale down are used. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--behavior))
- `metrics` (Attributes List) Metrics contains the specifications for which to use to calculate the desired replica count (the maximum replica count across all metrics will be used). The desired replica count is calculated multiplying the ratio between the target value and the current value by the current number of pods. Ergo, metrics used must decrease as the pod count is increased, and vice-versa. See the individual metric source types for more information about how each type of metric must respond. If not set, the default metric will be set to 80% average CPU utilization. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--metrics))
- `min_replicas` (Number) MinReplicas is the lower limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale down. It defaults to 1 pod.
