Optional:

- `mirroring` (Attributes) Mirroring defines the Mirroring service configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--mirroring))

Optional:

- `health_check` (Attributes) Healthcheck defines health checks for ExternalName services. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--mirroring--health_check))
- `kind` (String) Kind defines the kind of the Service.
- `max_body_size` (Number) MaxBodySize defines the maximum size allowed for the body of the request. If the body is larger, the request is not mirrored. Default value is -1, which means unlimited size.
