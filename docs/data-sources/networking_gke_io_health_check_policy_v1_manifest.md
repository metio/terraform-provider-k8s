# k8s_networking_gke_io_health_check_policy_v1_manifest (Data Source)

HealthCheckPolicy provides a way to create and attach a HealthCheck to a BackendService with the GKE implementation of the Gateway API. This policy can only be attached to a BackendService.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_networking_gke_io_health_check_policy_v1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
}
```

- `spec` (Attributes) Spec defines the desired state of HealthCheckPolicy. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

The value of grpcServiceName has the following meanings by convention: - Empty serviceName means the overall status of all services at the backend. - Non-empty serviceName means the health of that gRPC service, as defined by   the owner of the service. The grpcServiceName can only be ASCII.
- `port` (Number) The TCP port number for the health check request. Valid values are 1 through 65535.
