# k8s_stunner_l7mp_io_static_service_v1alpha1_manifest (Data Source)

StaticService is a set of static IP address prefixes STUNner allows access to via a Route. Thepurpose is to allow a Service-like CRD containing a set of static IP address prefixes to be setas the backend of a UDPRoute (or TCPRoute).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_stunner_l7mp_io_static_service_v1alpha1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) Spec defines the behavior of a service. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `prefixes` (List of String) Prefixes is a list of IP address prefixes reachable via this route.

Optional:

- `ports` (Attributes List) The list of ports reachable via this service (currently omitted). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--ports))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--ports"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.ports`

Required:

- `port` (Number) The port that will be exposed by this service.

Optional:

- `app_protocol` (String) The application protocol for this port.This is used as a hint for implementations to offer richer behavior for protocols that they understand.This field follows standard Kubernetes label syntax.Valid values are either:* Un-prefixed protocol names - reserved for IANA standard service names (as perRFC-6335 and https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names).* Kubernetes-defined prefixed names:  * 'kubernetes.io/h2c' - HTTP/2 prior knowledge over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html#name-starting-http-2-with-prior-  * 'kubernetes.io/ws'  - WebSocket over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455  * 'kubernetes.io/wss' - WebSocket over TLS as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455* Other protocols should use implementation-defined prefixed names such asmycompany.com/my-custom-protocol.
- `name` (String) The name of this port within the service. This must be a DNS_LABEL.All ports within a ServiceSpec must have unique names. When consideringthe endpoints for a Service, this must match the 'name' field in theEndpointPort.Optional if only one ServicePort is defined on this service.
- `node_port` (Number) The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type isNodePort or LoadBalancer.  Usually assigned by the system. If a value isspecified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise theoperation will fail.  If not specified, a port will be allocated if thisService requires one.  If this field is specified when creating aService which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will bewiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing typefrom NodePort to ClusterIP).More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport
- `protocol` (String) The IP protocol for this port. Supports 'TCP', 'UDP', and 'SCTP'.Default is TCP.
- `target_port` (String) Number or name of the port to access on the pods targeted by the service.Number must be in the range 1 to 65535. Name must be an IANA_SVC_NAME.If this is a string, it will be looked up as a named port in thetarget Pod's container ports. If this is not specified, the valueof the 'port' field is used (an identity map).This field is ignored for services with clusterIP=None, and should beomitted or set equal to the 'port' field.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#defining-a-service
