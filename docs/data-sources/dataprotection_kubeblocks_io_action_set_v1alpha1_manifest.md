ActionSet is the Schema for the actionsets API

## Example Usage

data "k8s_dataprotection_kubeblocks_io_action_set_v1alpha1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name = "some-name"

  }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) ActionSetSpec defines the desired state of ActionSet (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `backup_type` (String) Specifies the backup type. Supported values include:  - 'Full' for a full backup. - 'Incremental' back up data that have changed since the last backup (either full or incremental). - 'Differential' back up data that has changed since the last full backup. - 'Continuous' back up transaction logs continuously, such as MySQL binlog, PostgreSQL WAL, etc.  Continuous backup is essential for implementing Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR).

Optional:

- `backup` (Attributes) Specifies the backup action. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--backup))
- `env` (Map of String) Specifies a list of environment variables to be set in the container.
- `env_from` (Map of String) Specifies a list of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. Any invalid keys will be reported as an event when the container starts. If a key exists in multiple sources, the value from the last source will take precedence. Any values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence.  This field cannot be updated.
- `restore` (Attributes) Specifies the restore action. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--restore))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--backup"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.backup`

Optional:

- `backup_data` (Attributes) Represents the action to be performed for backing up data. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--backup--backup_data))
- `post_backup` (Attributes List) Represents a set of actions that should be executed after the backup process has completed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--backup--post_backup))
- `pre_backup` (Attributes List) Represents a set of actions that should be executed before the backup process begins. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--backup--pre_backup))
- `pre_delete` (Attributes) Represents a custom deletion action that can be executed before the built-in deletion action. Note: The preDelete action job will ignore the env/envFrom. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--backup--pre_delete))
