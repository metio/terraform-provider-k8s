- `clone_mode` (String) CloneMode specifies the type of clone operation. The LinkedClone mode is only support for templates that have at least one snapshot. If the template has no snapshots, then CloneMode defaults to FullClone. When LinkedClone mode is enabled the DiskGiB field is ignored as it is not possible to expand disks of linked clones. Defaults to LinkedClone, but fails gracefully to FullClone if the source of the clone operation has no snapshots.

If omitted, the timeout defaults to 5 minutes.

The soft mode requires the VM's guest to have VM Tools installed and attempts to gracefully shut down the VM. Its variant, trySoft, first attempts a graceful shutdown, and if that fails or the VM is not in a powered off state after reaching the GuestSoftPowerOffTimeout, the VM is halted. If omitted, the mode defaults to hard.

- `server` (String) Server is the IP address or FQDN of the vSphere server on which the virtual machine is created/located.
- `snapshot` (String) Snapshot is the name of the snapshot from which to create a linked clone. This field is ignored if LinkedClone is not enabled. Defaults to the source's current snapshot.
- `storage_policy_name` (String) StoragePolicyName of the storage policy to use with this Virtual Machine
