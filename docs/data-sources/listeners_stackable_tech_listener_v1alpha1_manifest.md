# k8s_listeners_stackable_tech_listener_v1alpha1_manifest (Data Source)

Auto-generated derived type for ListenerSpec via 'CustomResource'

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_listeners_stackable_tech_listener_v1alpha1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) Exposes a set of pods to the outside world. Essentially a Stackable extension of a Kubernetes Service. Compared to a Service, a Listener changes three things: 1. It uses a cluster-level policy object (ListenerClass) to define how exactly the exposure works 2. It has a consistent API for reading back the exposed address(es) of the service 3. The Pod must mount a Volume referring to the Listener, which also allows ['sticky' scheduling](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/nightly/listener-operator/listener#_sticky_scheduling). Learn more in the [Listener documentation](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/nightly/listener-operator/listener). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `class_name` (String) The name of the [ListenerClass](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/nightly/listener-operator/listenerclass).
- `extra_pod_selector_labels` (Map of String) Extra labels that the Pods must match in order to be exposed. They must _also_ still have a Volume referring to the Listener.
- `ports` (Attributes List) Ports that should be exposed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--ports))
- `publish_not_ready_addresses` (Boolean) Whether incoming traffic should also be directed to Pods that are not 'Ready'.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--ports"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.ports`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name of the port. The name of each port *must* be unique within a single Listener.
- `port` (Number) The port number.

Optional:

- `protocol` (String) The layer-4 protocol ('TCP' or 'UDP').
