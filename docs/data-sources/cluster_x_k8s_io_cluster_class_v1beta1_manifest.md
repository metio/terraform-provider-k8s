### Nested Schema for `spec.variables.schema.open_apiv3_schema.x_kubernetes_validations`

Required:

- `rule` (String) Rule represents the expression which will be evaluated by CEL. ref: https://github.com/google/cel-spec The Rule is scoped to the location of the x-kubernetes-validations extension in the schema. The 'self' variable in the CEL expression is bound to the scoped value. If the Rule is scoped to an object with properties, the accessible properties of the object are field selectable via 'self.field' and field presence can be checked via 'has(self.field)'. If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via 'self[mapKey]', map containment can be checked via 'mapKey in self' and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as 'self.all(...)'. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via 'self[i]' and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, 'self' is bound to the scalar value. Examples: - Rule scoped to a map of objects: {'rule': 'self.components['Widget'].priority < 10'} - Rule scoped to a list of integers: {'rule': 'self.values.all(value, value >= 0 && value < 100)'} - Rule scoped to a string value: {'rule': 'self.startsWith('kube')'} Unknown data preserved in custom resources via x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields is not accessible in CEL expressions. This includes: - Unknown field values that are preserved by object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields. - Object properties where the property schema is of an 'unknown type'. An 'unknown type' is recursively defined as: - A schema with no type and x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true - An array where the items schema is of an 'unknown type' - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an 'unknown type' Only property names of the form '[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*' are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '__' escapes to '__underscores__' - '.' escapes to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to '__slash__' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are: 'true', 'false', 'null', 'in', 'as', 'break', 'const', 'continue', 'else', 'for', 'function', 'if', 'import', 'let', 'loop', 'package', 'namespace', 'return'. Examples: - Rule accessing a property named 'namespace': {'rule': 'self.__namespace__ > 0'} - Rule accessing a property named 'x-prop': {'rule': 'self.x__dash__prop > 0'} - Rule accessing a property named 'redact__d': {'rule': 'self.redact__underscores__d > 0'} If 'rule' makes use of the 'oldSelf' variable it is implicitly a 'transition rule'. By default, the 'oldSelf' variable is the same type as 'self'. Transition rules by default are applied only on UPDATE requests and are skipped if an old value could not be found.

Optional:

- `field_path` (String) FieldPath represents the field path returned when the validation fails. It must be a relative JSON path (i.e. with array notation) scoped to the location of this x-kubernetes-validations extension in the schema and refer to an existing field. e.g. when validation checks if a specific attribute 'foo' under a map 'testMap', the fieldPath could be set to '.testMap.foo' If the validation checks two lists must have unique attributes, the fieldPath could be set to either of the list: e.g. '.testList' It does not support list numeric index. It supports child operation to refer to an existing field currently. Refer to [JSONPath support in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/) for more info. Numeric index of array is not supported. For field name which contains special characters, use '['specialName']' to refer the field name. e.g. for attribute 'foo.34$' appears in a list 'testList', the fieldPath could be set to '.testList['foo.34$']'
- `message` (String) Message represents the message displayed when validation fails. The message is required if the Rule contains line breaks. The message must not contain line breaks. If unset, the message is 'failed rule: {Rule}'. e.g. 'must be a URL with the host matching spec.host'
- `message_expression` (String) MessageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails. Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string. If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the validation failure message is produced as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset. messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type. Example: 'x must be less than max ('+string(self.max)+')'
- `reason` (String) Reason provides a machine-readable validation failure reason that is returned to the caller when a request fails this validation rule. The currently supported reasons are: 'FieldValueInvalid', 'FieldValueForbidden', 'FieldValueRequired', 'FieldValueDuplicate'. If not set, default to use 'FieldValueInvalid'. All future added reasons must be accepted by clients when reading this value and unknown reasons should be treated as FieldValueInvalid.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--workers--machine_deployments--strategy--remediation"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.workers.machine_deployments.strategy.remediation`

Optional:

- `max_in_flight` (String) MaxInFlight determines how many in flight remediations should happen at the same time. Remediation only happens on the MachineSet with the most current revision, while older MachineSets (usually present during rollout operations) aren't allowed to remediate. Note: In general (independent of remediations), unhealthy machines are always prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones. MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage. Example: when this is set to 20%, the MachineSet controller deletes at most 20% of the desired replicas. If not set, remediation is limited to all machines (bounded by replicas) under the active MachineSet's management.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--workers--machine_deployments--strategy--rolling_update"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.workers.machine_deployments.strategy.rolling_update`

Optional:

- `delete_policy` (String) DeletePolicy defines the policy used by the MachineDeployment to identify nodes to delete when downscaling. Valid values are 'Random, 'Newest', 'Oldest' When no value is supplied, the default DeletePolicy of MachineSet is used

Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired machines (ex: 10%). This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0. Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. Defaults to 1. Example: when this is set to 30%, the new MachineSet can be scaled up immediately when the rolling update starts, such that the total number of old and new machines do not exceed 130% of desired machines. Once old machines have been killed, new MachineSet can be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of machines running at any time during the update is at most 130% of desired machines.
- `max_unavailable` (String) The maximum number of machines that can be unavailable during the update. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired machines (ex: 10%). Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down. This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0. Defaults to 0. Example: when this is set to 30%, the old MachineSet can be scaled down to 70% of desired machines immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new machines are ready, old MachineSet can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new MachineSet, ensuring that the total number of machines available at all times during the update is at least 70% of desired machines.
