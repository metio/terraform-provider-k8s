data "k8s_cluster_x_k8s_io_cluster_class_v1beta1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }

- `unhealthy_range` (String) Any further remediation is only allowed if the number of machines selected by 'selector' as not healthyis within the range of 'UnhealthyRange'. Takes precedence over MaxUnhealthy.Eg. '[3-5]' - This means that remediation will be allowed only when:(a) there are at least 3 unhealthy machines (and)(b) there are at most 5 unhealthy machines
