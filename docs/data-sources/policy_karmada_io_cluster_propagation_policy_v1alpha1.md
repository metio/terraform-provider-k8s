# k8s_policy_karmada_io_cluster_propagation_policy_v1alpha1 (Data Source)

ClusterPropagationPolicy represents the cluster-wide policy that propagates a group of resources to one or more clusters. Different with PropagationPolicy that could only propagate resources in its own namespace, ClusterPropagationPolicy is able to propagate cluster level resources and resources in any namespace other than system reserved ones. System reserved namespaces are: karmada-system, karmada-cluster, karmada-es-*.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_policy_karmada_io_cluster_propagation_policy_v1alpha1" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name = "some-name"

  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.name`.
- `spec` (Attributes) Spec represents the desired behavior of ClusterPropagationPolicy. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Read-Only:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Read-Only:

- `association` (Boolean) Association tells if relevant resources should be selected automatically. e.g. a ConfigMap referred by a Deployment. default false. Deprecated: in favor of PropagateDeps.
- `conflict_resolution` (String) ConflictResolution declares how potential conflict should be handled when a resource that is being propagated already exists in the target cluster.  It defaults to 'Abort' which means stop propagating to avoid unexpected overwrites. The 'Overwrite' might be useful when migrating legacy cluster resources to Karmada, in which case conflict is predictable and can be instructed to Karmada take over the resource by overwriting.
- `dependent_overrides` (List of String) DependentOverrides represents the list of overrides(OverridePolicy) which must present before the current PropagationPolicy takes effect.  It used to explicitly specify overrides which current PropagationPolicy rely on. A typical scenario is the users create OverridePolicy(ies) and resources at the same time, they want to ensure the new-created policies would be adopted.  Note: For the overrides, OverridePolicy(ies) in current namespace and ClusterOverridePolicy(ies), which not present in this list will still be applied if they matches the resources.
- `failover` (Attributes) Failover indicates how Karmada migrates applications in case of failures. If this value is nil, failover is disabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--failover))
- `placement` (Attributes) Placement represents the rule for select clusters to propagate resources. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--placement))
- `preemption` (String) Preemption declares the behaviors for preempting. Valid options are 'Always' and 'Never'.
- `priority` (Number) Priority indicates the importance of a policy(PropagationPolicy or ClusterPropagationPolicy). A policy will be applied for the matched resource templates if there is no other policies with higher priority at the point of the resource template be processed. Once a resource template has been claimed by a policy, by default it will not be preempted by following policies even with a higher priority. See Preemption for more details.  In case of two policies have the same priority, the one with a more precise matching rules in ResourceSelectors wins: - matching by name(resourceSelector.name) has higher priority than by selector(resourceSelector.labelSelector) - matching by selector(resourceSelector.labelSelector) has higher priority than by APIVersion(resourceSelector.apiVersion) and Kind(resourceSelector.kind). If there is still no winner at this point, the one with the lower alphabetic order wins, e.g. policy 'bar' has higher priority than 'foo'.  The higher the value, the higher the priority. Defaults to zero.
- `propagate_deps` (Boolean) PropagateDeps tells if relevant resources should be propagated automatically. Take 'Deployment' which referencing 'ConfigMap' and 'Secret' as an example, when 'propagateDeps' is 'true', the referencing resources could be omitted(for saving config effort) from 'resourceSelectors' as they will be propagated along with the Deployment. In addition to the propagating process, the referencing resources will be migrated along with the Deployment in the fail-over scenario.  Defaults to false.
- `resource_selectors` (Attributes List) ResourceSelectors used to select resources. Nil or empty selector is not allowed and doesn't mean match all kinds of resources for security concerns that sensitive resources(like Secret) might be accidentally propagated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--resource_selectors))
- `scheduler_name` (String) SchedulerName represents which scheduler to proceed the scheduling. If specified, the policy will be dispatched by specified scheduler. If not specified, the policy will be dispatched by default scheduler.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--failover"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.failover`

Read-Only:

- `application` (Attributes) Application indicates failover behaviors in case of application failure. If this value is nil, failover is disabled. If set, the PropagateDeps should be true so that the dependencies could be migrated along with the application. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--failover--application))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--failover--application"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.failover.application`

Read-Only:

- `decision_conditions` (Attributes) DecisionConditions indicates the decision conditions of performing the failover process. Only when all conditions are met can the failover process be performed. Currently, DecisionConditions includes several conditions: - TolerationSeconds (optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--failover--application--decision_conditions))
- `grace_period_seconds` (Number) GracePeriodSeconds is the maximum waiting duration in seconds before application on the migrated cluster should be deleted. Required only when PurgeMode is 'Graciously' and defaults to 600s. If the application on the new cluster cannot reach a Healthy state, Karmada will delete the application after GracePeriodSeconds is reached. Value must be positive integer.
- `purge_mode` (String) PurgeMode represents how to deal with the legacy applications on the cluster from which the application is migrated. Valid options are 'Immediately', 'Graciously' and 'Never'. Defaults to 'Graciously'.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--failover--application--decision_conditions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.failover.application.purge_mode`

Read-Only:

- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time Karmada should wait after reaching the desired state before performing failover process. If not specified, Karmada will immediately perform failover process. Defaults to 300s.




<a id="nestedatt--spec--placement"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.placement`

Read-Only:

- `cluster_affinities` (Attributes List) ClusterAffinities represents scheduling restrictions to multiple cluster groups that indicated by ClusterAffinityTerm.  The scheduler will evaluate these groups one by one in the order they appear in the spec, the group that does not satisfy scheduling restrictions will be ignored which means all clusters in this group will not be selected unless it also belongs to the next group(a cluster could belong to multiple groups).  If none of the groups satisfy the scheduling restrictions, then scheduling fails, which means no cluster will be selected.  Note: 1. ClusterAffinities can not co-exist with ClusterAffinity. 2. If both ClusterAffinity and ClusterAffinities are not set, any cluster can be scheduling candidates.  Potential use case 1: The private clusters in the local data center could be the main group, and the managed clusters provided by cluster providers could be the secondary group. So that the Karmada scheduler would prefer to schedule workloads to the main group and the second group will only be considered in case of the main group does not satisfy restrictions(like, lack of resources).  Potential use case 2: For the disaster recovery scenario, the clusters could be organized to primary and backup groups, the workloads would be scheduled to primary clusters firstly, and when primary cluster fails(like data center power off), Karmada scheduler could migrate workloads to the backup clusters. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--placement--cluster_affinities))
- `cluster_affinity` (Attributes) ClusterAffinity represents scheduling restrictions to a certain set of clusters. Note: 1. ClusterAffinity can not co-exist with ClusterAffinities. 2. If both ClusterAffinity and ClusterAffinities are not set, any cluster can be scheduling candidates. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--placement--cluster_affinity))
- `cluster_tolerations` (Attributes List) ClusterTolerations represents the tolerations. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--placement--cluster_tolerations))
- `replica_scheduling` (Attributes) ReplicaScheduling represents the scheduling policy on dealing with the number of replicas when propagating resources that have replicas in spec (e.g. deployments, statefulsets) to member clusters. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--placement--replica_scheduling))
- `spread_constraints` (Attributes List) SpreadConstraints represents a list of the scheduling constraints. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--placement--spread_constraints))
