# k8s_camel_apache_org_integration_kit_v1 (Data Source)

IntegrationKit defines a container image and additional configuration needed to run an 'Integration'. An 'IntegrationKit' is a generic image generally built from the requirements of an 'Integration', but agnostic to it, in order to be reused by any other 'Integration' which has the same required set of capabilities. An 'IntegrationKit' may be used for other kits as a base container layer, when the 'incremental' build option is enabled.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_camel_apache_org_integration_kit_v1" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"

  }
}
```

<a id="nestedatt--spec--configuration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.configuration`

Read-Only:

### Nested Schema for `spec.sources`

Read-Only:

- `compression` (Boolean) if the content is compressed (base64 encrypted)
- `content` (String) the source code (plain text)
- `content_key` (String) the confimap key holding the source content
- `content_ref` (String) the confimap reference holding the source content
- `content_type` (String) the content type (tipically text or binary)

<a id="nestedatt--spec--traits"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.traits`

Read-Only:

- `addons` (Map of String) The collection of addon trait configurations
- `builder` (Attributes) The builder trait is internally used to determine the best strategy to build and configure IntegrationKits. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--traits--builder))
- `camel` (Attributes) The Camel trait sets up Camel configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--traits--camel))
- `quarkus` (Attributes) The Quarkus trait configures the Quarkus runtime. It's enabled by default. NOTE: Compiling to a native executable, i.e. when using 'package-type=native', is only supported for kamelets, as well as YAML and XML integrations. It also requires at least 4GiB of memory, so the Pod running the native build, that is either the operator Pod, or the build Pod (depending on the build strategy configured for the platform), must have enough memory available. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--traits--quarkus))
- `registry` (Attributes) The Registry trait sets up Maven to use the Image registry as a Maven repository. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--traits--registry))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--traits--builder"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.traits.builder`

Read-Only:

- `enabled` (Boolean) Can be used to enable or disable a trait. All traits share this common property.
- `limit_cpu` (String) When using 'pod' strategy, the maximum amount of CPU required by the pod builder.
- `limit_memory` (String) When using 'pod' strategy, the maximum amount of memory required by the pod builder.
- `maven_profiles` (List of String) A list of references pointing to configmaps/secrets that contains a maven profile. The content of the maven profile is expected to be a text containing a valid maven profile starting with '<profile>' and ending with '</profile>' that will be integrated as an inline profile in the POM. Syntax: [configmap|secret]:name[/key], where name represents the resource name, key optionally represents the resource key to be filtered (default key value = profile.xml).
- `order_strategy` (String) The build order strategy to use, either 'dependencies', 'fifo' or 'sequential' (default sequential)

Read-Only:

- `configuration` (Map of String) Legacy trait configuration parameters. Deprecated: for backward compatibility.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Can be used to enable or disable a trait. All traits share this common property.
- `properties` (List of String) A list of properties to be provided to the Integration runtime
- `runtime_version` (String) The camel-k-runtime version to use for the integration. It overrides the default version set in the Integration Platform.

- `enabled` (Boolean) Can be used to enable or disable a trait. All traits share this common property.

The order influences the resolution of the current kit for the integration. The kit corresponding to the first package type will be assigned to the integration in case no existing kit that matches the integration exists.
