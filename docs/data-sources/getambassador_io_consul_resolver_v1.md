### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.
- `spec` (Attributes) ConsulResolver tells Ambassador to use Consul to resolve services. In addition to the AmbassadorID, it needs information about which Consul server and DC to use. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))
