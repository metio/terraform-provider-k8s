# k8s_tests_testkube_io_test_trigger_v1 (Data Source)

TestTrigger is the Schema for the testtriggers API

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_tests_testkube_io_test_trigger_v1" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"

  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) The API group of the requested resource.
- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.
- `kind` (String) The type of the requested resource.
- `spec` (Attributes) TestTriggerSpec defines the desired state of TestTrigger (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Read-Only:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Read-Only:

- `action` (String) Action represents what needs to be executed for selected Execution
- `condition_spec` (Attributes) What resource conditions should be matched (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--condition_spec))
- `delay` (String) Delay is a duration string which specifies how long should the test be delayed after a trigger is matched
- `event` (String) On which Event for a Resource should an Action be triggered
- `execution` (String) Execution identifies for which test execution should an Action be executed
- `probe_spec` (Attributes) What resource probes should be matched (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--probe_spec))
- `resource` (String) For which Resource do we monitor Event which triggers an Action on certain conditions
- `resource_selector` (Attributes) ResourceSelector identifies which Kubernetes Objects should be watched (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--resource_selector))
- `test_selector` (Attributes) TestSelector identifies on which Testkube Kubernetes Objects an Action should be taken (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--test_selector))

- `timeout` (Number) duration in seconds the test trigger waits for conditions, until its stopped

<a id="nestedatt--spec--condition_spec--conditions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.condition_spec.conditions`

Read-Only:

<a id="nestedatt--spec--resource_selector"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.resource_selector`

Read-Only:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector is used to identify a group of Kubernetes Objects based on their metadata labels (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--resource_selector--label_selector))

### Nested Schema for `spec.resource_selector.label_selector`

Read-Only:

- `match_labels` (Map of String) matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.
