### Nested Schema for `spec.network_options.command_config`

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to add to the Ingress or Route during its creation.
- `ingress_spec` (Attributes) Configuration for an Ingress object. Currently subpaths are not supported, so unique hosts must be specified (if a single external IP is being used) to differentiate between ingresses/services. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_options--command_config--ingress_spec))
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to add to the Ingress or Route during its creation. The label with key 'app' is reserved for use by the operator.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--network_options--command_config--ingress_spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.network_options.command_config.ingress_spec`

Optional:

- `default_backend` (Attributes) defaultBackend is the backend that should handle requests that don't match any rule. If Rules are not specified, DefaultBackend must be specified. If DefaultBackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the Ingress controller. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_options--command_config--ingress_spec--default_backend))
- `ingress_class_name` (String) ingressClassName is the name of an IngressClass cluster resource. Ingress controller implementations use this field to know whether they should be serving this Ingress resource, by a transitive connection (controller -> IngressClass -> Ingress resource). Although the 'kubernetes.io/ingress.class' annotation (simple constant name) was never formally defined, it was widely supported by Ingress controllers to create a direct binding between Ingress controller and Ingress resources. Newly created Ingress resources should prefer using the field. However, even though the annotation is officially deprecated, for backwards compatibility reasons, ingress controllers should still honor that annotation if present.
- `rules` (Attributes List) rules is a list of host rules used to configure the Ingress. If unspecified, or no rule matches, all traffic is sent to the default backend. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_options--command_config--ingress_spec--rules))
- `tls` (Attributes List) tls represents the TLS configuration. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_options--command_config--ingress_spec--tls))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--network_options--command_config--ingress_spec--default_backend"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.network_options.command_config.ingress_spec.default_backend`

Optional:

- `resource` (Attributes) resource is an ObjectRef to another Kubernetes resource in the namespace of the Ingress object. If resource is specified, a service.Name and service.Port must not be specified. This is a mutually exclusive setting with 'Service'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_options--command_config--ingress_spec--default_backend--resource))
- `service` (Attributes) service references a service as a backend. This is a mutually exclusive setting with 'Resource'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_options--command_config--ingress_spec--default_backend--service))

Optional:

- `port` (Attributes) port of the referenced service. A port name or port number is required for a IngressServiceBackend. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_options--command_config--ingress_spec--default_backend--service--port))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--network_options--command_config--ingress_spec--default_backend--service--port"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.network_options.command_config.ingress_spec.default_backend.service.port`

Optional:

- `name` (String) name is the name of the port on the Service. This is a mutually exclusive setting with 'Number'.
- `number` (Number) number is the numerical port number (e.g. 80) on the Service. This is a mutually exclusive setting with 'Name'.




<a id="nestedatt--spec--network_options--command_config--ingress_spec--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.network_options.command_config.ingress_spec.rules`

Optional:

- `host` (String) host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the 'host' part of the URI as defined in RFC 3986: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The ':' delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue. host can be 'precise' which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. 'foo.bar.com') or 'wildcard', which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. '*.foo.com'). The wildcard character '*' must appear by itself as the first DNS label and matches only a single label. You cannot have a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == '*'). Requests will be matched against the Host field in the following way: 1. If host is precise, the request matches this rule if the http host header is equal to Host. 2. If host is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule if the http host header is to equal to the suffix (removing the first label) of the wildcard rule.
- `http` (Attributes) HTTPIngressRuleValue is a list of http selectors pointing to backends. In the example: http://<host>/<path>?<searchpart> -> backend where where parts of the url correspond to RFC 3986, this resource will be used to match against everything after the last '/' and before the first '?' or '#'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_options--command_config--ingress_spec--rules--http))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--network_options--command_config--ingress_spec--rules--http"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.network_options.command_config.ingress_spec.rules.http`

Required:

- `paths` (Attributes List) paths is a collection of paths that map requests to backends. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_options--command_config--ingress_spec--rules--http--paths))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--network_options--command_config--ingress_spec--rules--http--paths"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.network_options.command_config.ingress_spec.rules.http.paths`

Required:

- `backend` (Attributes) backend defines the referenced service endpoint to which the traffic will be forwarded to. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_options--command_config--ingress_spec--rules--http--paths--backend))
- `path_type` (String) pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can be one of the following values: * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly. * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz). * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types. Implementations are required to support all path types.

Optional:

- `path` (String) path is matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional 'path' part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a '/' and must be present when using PathType with value 'Exact' or 'Prefix'.

Optional:

- `hosts` (List of String) hosts is a list of hosts included in the TLS certificate. The values in this list must match the name/s used in the tlsSecret. Defaults to the wildcard host setting for the loadbalancer controller fulfilling this Ingress, if left unspecified.
- `secret_name` (String) secretName is the name of the secret used to terminate TLS traffic on port 443. Field is left optional to allow TLS routing based on SNI hostname alone. If the SNI host in a listener conflicts with the 'Host' header field used by an IngressRule, the SNI host is used for termination and value of the 'Host' header is used for routing.

### Nested Schema for `spec.network_options.core_config.ingress_spec.rules.http.paths.backend.service.port`

Optional:

- `name` (String) name is the name of the port on the Service. This is a mutually exclusive setting with 'Number'.

### Nested Schema for `spec.network_options.core_config.ingress_spec.tls`

Optional:

- `hosts` (List of String) hosts is a list of hosts included in the TLS certificate. The values in this list must match the name/s used in the tlsSecret. Defaults to the wildcard host setting for the loadbalancer controller fulfilling this Ingress, if left unspecified.
- `secret_name` (String) secretName is the name of the secret used to terminate TLS traffic on port 443. Field is left optional to allow TLS routing based on SNI hostname alone. If the SNI host in a listener conflicts with the 'Host' header field used by an IngressRule, the SNI host is used for termination and value of the 'Host' header is used for routing.




<a id="nestedatt--spec--network_options--grafana_config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.network_options.grafana_config`

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to add to the Ingress or Route during its creation.
- `ingress_spec` (Attributes) Configuration for an Ingress object. Currently subpaths are not supported, so unique hosts must be specified (if a single external IP is being used) to differentiate between ingresses/services. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_options--grafana_config--ingress_spec))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--network_options--grafana_config--ingress_spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.network_options.grafana_config.ingress_spec`

Optional:

- `default_backend` (Attributes) defaultBackend is the backend that should handle requests that don't match any rule. If Rules are not specified, DefaultBackend must be specified. If DefaultBackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the Ingress controller. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_options--grafana_config--ingress_spec--default_backend))
- `ingress_class_name` (String) ingressClassName is the name of an IngressClass cluster resource. Ingress controller implementations use this field to know whether they should be serving this Ingress resource, by a transitive connection (controller -> IngressClass -> Ingress resource). Although the 'kubernetes.io/ingress.class' annotation (simple constant name) was never formally defined, it was widely supported by Ingress controllers to create a direct binding between Ingress controller and Ingress resources. Newly created Ingress resources should prefer using the field. However, even though the annotation is officially deprecated, for backwards compatibility reasons, ingress controllers should still honor that annotation if present.
- `rules` (Attributes List) rules is a list of host rules used to configure the Ingress. If unspecified, or no rule matches, all traffic is sent to the default backend. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_options--grafana_config--ingress_spec--rules))
- `tls` (Attributes List) tls represents the TLS configuration. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--network_options--grafana_config--ingress_spec--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.network_options.grafana_config.ingress_spec.rules`

Optional:

- `host` (String) host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the 'host' part of the URI as defined in RFC 3986: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The ':' delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue. host can be 'precise' which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. 'foo.bar.com') or 'wildcard', which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. '*.foo.com'). The wildcard character '*' must appear by itself as the first DNS label and matches only a single label. You cannot have a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == '*'). Requests will be matched against the Host field in the following way: 1. If host is precise, the request matches this rule if the http host header is equal to Host. 2. If host is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule if the http host header is to equal to the suffix (removing the first label) of the wildcard rule.
- `http` (Attributes) HTTPIngressRuleValue is a list of http selectors pointing to backends. In the example: http://<host>/<path>?<searchpart> -> backend where where parts of the url correspond to RFC 3986, this resource will be used to match against everything after the last '/' and before the first '?' or '#'.

### Nested Schema for `spec.network_options.grafana_config.ingress_spec.rules.http.paths`

Required:

- `backend` (Attributes) backend defines the referenced service endpoint to which the traffic will be forwarded to. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--network_options--grafana_config--ingress_spec--rules--http--paths--backend))
- `path_type` (String) pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can be one of the following values: * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly. * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz). * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types. Implementations are required to support all path types.

Optional:

- `path` (String) path is matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional 'path' part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a '/' and must be present when using PathType with value 'Exact' or 'Prefix'.

- `data_source` (Attributes) dataSource field can be used to specify either: * An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot) * An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source, it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source. When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef, and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified. If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage_options--pvc--spec--data_source))
- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty. There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified. * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage_options--pvc--spec--data_source_ref))
- `resources` (Attributes) resources represents the minimum resources the volume should have. If RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature is enabled users are allowed to specify resource requirements that are lower than previous value but must still be higher than capacity recorded in the status field of the claim. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#resources (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage_options--pvc--spec--resources))
- `selector` (Attributes) selector is a label query over volumes to consider for binding. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage_options--pvc--spec--selector))
- `storage_class_name` (String) storageClassName is the name of the StorageClass required by the claim. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1
- `volume_mode` (String) volumeMode defines what type of volume is required by the claim. Value of Filesystem is implied when not included in claim spec.
- `volume_name` (String) volumeName is the binding reference to the PersistentVolume backing this claim.

### Nested Schema for `spec.storage_options.pvc.spec.data_source`

Required:

- `kind` (String) Kind is the type of resource being referenced
- `name` (String) Name is the name of resource being referenced

Optional:

- `api_group` (String) APIGroup is the group for the resource being referenced. If APIGroup is not specified, the specified Kind must be in the core API group. For any other third-party types, APIGroup is required.

### Nested Schema for `spec.storage_options.pvc.spec.data_source_ref`

Required:

- `kind` (String) Kind is the type of resource being referenced
- `name` (String) Name is the name of resource being referenced

Optional:

- `api_group` (String) APIGroup is the group for the resource being referenced. If APIGroup is not specified, the specified Kind must be in the core API group. For any other third-party types, APIGroup is required.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace is the namespace of resource being referenced Note that when a namespace is specified, a gateway.networking.k8s.io/ReferenceGrant object is required in the referent namespace to allow that namespace's owner to accept the reference. See the ReferenceGrant documentation for details. (Alpha) This field requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--storage_options--pvc--spec--resources"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.storage_options.pvc.spec.resources`

Optional:

- `claims` (Attributes List) Claims lists the names of resources, defined in spec.resourceClaims, that are used by this container. This is an alpha field and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate. This field is immutable. It can only be set for containers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage_options--pvc--spec--resources--claims))
- `limits` (Map of String) Limits describes the maximum amount of compute resources allowed. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/
- `requests` (Map of String) Requests describes the minimum amount of compute resources required. If Requests is omitted for a container, it defaults to Limits if that is explicitly specified, otherwise to an implementation-defined value. Requests cannot exceed Limits. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/
