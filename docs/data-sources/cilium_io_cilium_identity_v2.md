  CiliumIdentity is a CRD that represents an identity managed by Cilium. It is intended as a backing store for identity allocation, acting as the global coordination backend, and can be used in place of a KVStore (such as etcd). The name of the CRD is the numeric identity and the labels on the CRD object are the kubernetes sourced labels seen by cilium. This is currently the only label source possible when running under kubernetes. Non-kubernetes labels are filtered but all labels, from all sources, are places in the SecurityLabels field. These also include the source and are used to define the identity. The labels under metav1.ObjectMeta can be used when searching for CiliumIdentity instances that include particular labels. This can be done with invocations such as:  kubectl get ciliumid -l 'foo=bar'

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Read-Only:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.
