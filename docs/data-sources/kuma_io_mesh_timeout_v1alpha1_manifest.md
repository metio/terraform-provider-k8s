## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) Spec is the specification of the Kuma MeshTimeout resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `from` (Attributes List) From list makes a match between clients and corresponding configurations (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from))
- `target_ref` (Attributes) TargetRef is a reference to the resource the policy takes an effect on.The resource could be either a real store object or virtual resourcedefined inplace. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--target_ref))
- `to` (Attributes List) To list makes a match between the consumed services and corresponding configurations (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--to))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--from"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.from`

Required:

- `target_ref` (Attributes) TargetRef is a reference to the resource that represents a group ofclients. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--target_ref))

Optional:

- `default` (Attributes) Default is a configuration specific to the group of clients referenced in'targetRef' (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--from--target_ref"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.from.target_ref`

Optional:

- `kind` (String) Kind of the referenced resource
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels are used to select group of MeshServices that match labels. Either Labels orName and Namespace can be used.
- `mesh` (String) Mesh is reserved for future use to identify cross mesh resources.
- `name` (String) Name of the referenced resource. Can only be used with kinds: 'MeshService','MeshServiceSubset' and 'MeshGatewayRoute'
- `namespace` (String) Namespace specifies the namespace of target resource. If empty only resources in policy namespacewill be targeted.
- `proxy_types` (List of String) ProxyTypes specifies the data plane types that are subject to the policy. When not specified,all data plane types are targeted by the policy.
- `section_name` (String) SectionName is used to target specific section of resource.For example, you can target port from MeshService.ports[] by its name. Only traffic to this port will be affected.
- `tags` (Map of String) Tags used to select a subset of proxies by tags. Can only be used with kinds'MeshSubset' and 'MeshServiceSubset'


<a id="nestedatt--spec--from--default"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.from.default`

Optional:

- `connection_timeout` (String) ConnectionTimeout specifies the amount of time proxy will wait for an TCP connection to be established.Default value is 5 seconds. Cannot be set to 0.
- `http` (Attributes) Http provides configuration for HTTP specific timeouts (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--http))
- `idle_timeout` (String) IdleTimeout is defined as the period in which there are no bytes sent or received on connectionSetting this timeout to 0 will disable it. Be cautious when disabling it becauseit can lead to connection leaking. Default value is 1h.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--from--default--http"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.from.default.http`

Optional:

- `max_connection_duration` (String) MaxConnectionDuration is the time after which a connection will be drained and/or closed,starting from when it was first established. Setting this timeout to 0 will disable it.Disabled by default.
- `max_stream_duration` (String) MaxStreamDuration is the maximum time that a stream’s lifetime will span.Setting this timeout to 0 will disable it. Disabled by default.
- `request_headers_timeout` (String) RequestHeadersTimeout The amount of time that proxy will wait for the request headers to be received. The timer isactivated when the first byte of the headers is received, and is disarmed when the last byte ofthe headers has been received. If not specified or set to 0, this timeout is disabled.Disabled by default.
- `request_timeout` (String) RequestTimeout The amount of time that proxy will wait for the entire request to be received.The timer is activated when the request is initiated, and is disarmed when the last byte of the request is sent,OR when the response is initiated. Setting this timeout to 0 will disable it.Default is 15s.
- `stream_idle_timeout` (String) StreamIdleTimeout is the amount of time that proxy will allow a stream to exist with no activity.Setting this timeout to 0 will disable it. Default is 30m
