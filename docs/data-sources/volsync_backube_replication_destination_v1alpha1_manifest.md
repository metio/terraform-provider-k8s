# k8s_volsync_backube_replication_destination_v1alpha1_manifest (Data Source)

A ReplicationDestination is a VolSync resource that you can use to define the destination of a VolSync replicationor synchronization.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_volsync_backube_replication_destination_v1alpha1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
}

- `fs_group` (Number) A special supplemental group that applies to all containers in a pod.Some volume types allow the Kubelet to change the ownership of that volumeto be owned by the pod:1. The owning GID will be the FSGroup2. The setgid bit is set (new files created in the volume will be owned by FSGroup)3. The permission bits are OR'd with rw-rw----If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and permissions of any volume.Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
- `fs_group_change_policy` (String) fsGroupChangePolicy defines behavior of changing ownership and permission of the volumebefore being exposed inside Pod. This field will only apply tovolume types which support fsGroup based ownership(and permissions).It will have no effect on ephemeral volume types such as: secret, configmapsand emptydir.Valid values are 'OnRootMismatch' and 'Always'. If not specified, 'Always' is used.Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
- `run_as_group` (Number) The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process.Uses runtime default if unset.May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext andPodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedencefor that container.Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
- `run_as_non_root` (Boolean) Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user.If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that itdoes not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does.If unset or false, no such validation will be performed.May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext andPodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.
- `run_as_user` (Number) The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process.Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified.May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext andPodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedencefor that container.Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
- `se_linux_options` (Attributes) The SELinux context to be applied to all containers.If unspecified, the container runtime will allocate a random SELinux context for eachcontainer.  May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set inboth SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContexttakes precedence for that container.Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--rsync_tls--mover_security_context--se_linux_options))
- `seccomp_profile` (Attributes) The seccomp options to use by the containers in this pod.Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--rsync_tls--mover_security_context--seccomp_profile))
- `supplemental_groups` (List of String) A list of groups applied to the first process run in each container, in additionto the container's primary GID, the fsGroup (if specified), and group membershipsdefined in the container image for the uid of the container process. If unspecified,no additional groups are added to any container. Note that group membershipsdefined in the container image for the uid of the container process are still effective,even if they are not included in this list.Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
- `sysctls` (Attributes List) Sysctls hold a list of namespaced sysctls used for the pod. Pods with unsupportedsysctls (by the container runtime) might fail to launch.Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--rsync_tls--mover_security_context--sysctls))
- `windows_options` (Attributes) The Windows specific settings applied to all containers.If unspecified, the options within a container's SecurityContext will be used.If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is linux. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--rsync_tls--mover_security_context--windows_options))

### Nested Schema for `spec.rsync_tls.mover_security_context.app_armor_profile`

Required:

- `type` (String) type indicates which kind of AppArmor profile will be applied.Valid options are:  Localhost - a profile pre-loaded on the node.  RuntimeDefault - the container runtime's default profile.  Unconfined - no AppArmor enforcement.

Optional:

- `localhost_profile` (String) localhostProfile indicates a profile loaded on the node that should be used.The profile must be preconfigured on the node to work.Must match the loaded name of the profile.Must be set if and only if type is 'Localhost'.

### Nested Schema for `spec.rsync_tls.mover_security_context.se_linux_options`

Optional:

- `level` (String) Level is SELinux level label that applies to the container.
- `role` (String) Role is a SELinux role label that applies to the container.
- `type` (String) Type is a SELinux type label that applies to the container.
- `user` (String) User is a SELinux user label that applies to the container.

### Nested Schema for `spec.rsync_tls.mover_security_context.seccomp_profile`

Required:

- `type` (String) type indicates which kind of seccomp profile will be applied.Valid options are:Localhost - a profile defined in a file on the node should be used.RuntimeDefault - the container runtime default profile should be used.Unconfined - no profile should be applied.

Optional:

### Nested Schema for `spec.rsync_tls.mover_security_context.windows_options`

Optional:

- `gmsa_credential_spec` (String) GMSACredentialSpec is where the GMSA admission webhook(https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/windows-gmsa) inlines the contents of theGMSA credential spec named by the GMSACredentialSpecName field.
- `gmsa_credential_spec_name` (String) GMSACredentialSpecName is the name of the GMSA credential spec to use.
- `host_process` (Boolean) HostProcess determines if a container should be run as a 'Host Process' container.All of a Pod's containers must have the same effective HostProcess value(it is not allowed to have a mix of HostProcess containers and non-HostProcess containers).In addition, if HostProcess is true then HostNetwork must also be set to true.
- `run_as_user_name` (String) The UserName in Windows to run the entrypoint of the container process.Defaults to the user specified in image metadata if unspecified.May also be set in PodSecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext andPodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.




<a id="nestedatt--spec--trigger"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.trigger`

Optional:

- `manual` (String) manual is a string value that schedules a manual trigger.Once a sync completes then status.lastManualSync is set to the same string value.A consumer of a manual trigger should set spec.trigger.manual to a known valueand then wait for lastManualSync to be updated by the operator to the same value,which means that the manual trigger will then pause and wait for furtherupdates to the trigger.
- `schedule` (String) schedule is a cronspec (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview) thatcan be used to schedule replication to occur at regular, time-basedintervals.nolint:lll
