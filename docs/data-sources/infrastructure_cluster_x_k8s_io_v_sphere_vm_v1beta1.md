Read-Only:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Read-Only:

- `additional_disks_gi_b` (List of String) AdditionalDisksGiB holds the sizes of additional disks of the virtual machine, in GiB Defaults to the eponymous property value in the template from which the virtual machine is cloned.
- `bios_uuid` (String) BiosUUID is the VM's BIOS UUID that is assigned at runtime after the VM has been created. This field is required at runtime for other controllers that read this CRD as unstructured data.
- `bootstrap_ref` (Attributes) BootstrapRef is a reference to a bootstrap provider-specific resource that holds configuration details. This field is optional in case no bootstrap data is required to create a VM. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--bootstrap_ref))
- `clone_mode` (String) CloneMode specifies the type of clone operation. The LinkedClone mode is only support for templates that have at least one snapshot. If the template has no snapshots, then CloneMode defaults to FullClone. When LinkedClone mode is enabled the DiskGiB field is ignored as it is not possible to expand disks of linked clones. Defaults to LinkedClone, but fails gracefully to FullClone if the source of the clone operation has no snapshots.
- `custom_vmx_keys` (Map of String) CustomVMXKeys is a dictionary of advanced VMX options that can be set on VM Defaults to empty map

- `folder` (String) Folder is the name or inventory path of the folder in which the virtual machine is created/located.
- `guest_soft_power_off_timeout` (String) GuestSoftPowerOffTimeout sets the wait timeout for shutdown in the VM guest. The VM will be powered off forcibly after the timeout if the VM is still up and running when the PowerOffMode is set to trySoft.  This parameter only applies when the PowerOffMode is set to trySoft.  If omitted, the timeout defaults to 5 minutes.
- `hardware_version` (String) HardwareVersion is the hardware version of the virtual machine. Defaults to the eponymous property value in the template from which the virtual machine is cloned. Check the compatibility with the ESXi version before setting the value.
- `memory_mi_b` (Number) MemoryMiB is the size of a virtual machine's memory, in MiB. Defaults to the eponymous property value in the template from which the virtual machine is cloned.

The first mode, hard, is the equivalent of a physical system's power cord being ripped from the wall. The soft mode requires the VM's guest to have VM Tools installed and attempts to gracefully shut down the VM. Its variant, trySoft, first attempts a graceful shutdown, and if that fails or the VM is not in a powered off state after reaching the GuestSoftPowerOffTimeout, the VM is halted.  If omitted, the mode defaults to hard.
- `resource_pool` (String) ResourcePool is the name or inventory path of the resource pool in which the virtual machine is created/located.
- `server` (String) Server is the IP address or FQDN of the vSphere server on which the virtual machine is created/located.

- `storage_policy_name` (String) StoragePolicyName of the storage policy to use with this Virtual Machine
- `tag_i_ds` (List of String) TagIDs is an optional set of tags to add to an instance. Specified tagIDs must use URN-notation instead of display names.
- `template` (String) Template is the name or inventory path of the template used to clone the virtual machine.
- `thumbprint` (String) Thumbprint is the colon-separated SHA-1 checksum of the given vCenter server's host certificate When this is set to empty, this VirtualMachine would be created without TLS certificate validation of the communication between Cluster API Provider vSphere and the VMware vCenter server.
