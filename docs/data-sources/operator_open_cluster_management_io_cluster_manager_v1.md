# k8s_operator_open_cluster_management_io_cluster_manager_v1 (Data Source)

ClusterManager configures the controllers on the hub that govern registration and work distribution for attached Klusterlets. In Default mode, ClusterManager will only be deployed in open-cluster-management-hub namespace. In Hosted mode, ClusterManager will be deployed in the namespace with the same name as cluster manager.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_operator_open_cluster_management_io_cluster_manager_v1" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name = "some-name"

  }
}
```

### Nested Schema for `spec.add_on_manager_configuration`

Read-Only:

- `feature_gates` (Attributes List) FeatureGates represents the list of feature gates for addon manager If it is set empty, default feature gates will be used. If it is set, featuregate/Foo is an example of one item in FeatureGates: 1. If featuregate/Foo does not exist, registration-operator will discard it 2. If featuregate/Foo exists and is false by default. It is now possible to set featuregate/Foo=[false|true] 3. If featuregate/Foo exists and is true by default. If a cluster-admin upgrading from 1 to 2 wants to continue having featuregate/Foo=false, he can set featuregate/Foo=false before upgrading. Let's say the cluster-admin wants featuregate/Foo=false. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--add_on_manager_configuration--feature_gates))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--add_on_manager_configuration--feature_gates"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.add_on_manager_configuration.feature_gates`

Read-Only:

- `feature` (String) Feature is the key of feature gate. e.g. featuregate/Foo.
- `mode` (String) Mode is either Enable, Disable, '' where '' is Disable by default. In Enable mode, a valid feature gate 'featuregate/Foo' will be set to '--featuregate/Foo=true'. In Disable mode, a valid feature gate 'featuregate/Foo' will be set to '--featuregate/Foo=false'.



<a id="nestedatt--spec--deploy_option"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.deploy_option`

Read-Only:

- `hosted` (Attributes) Hosted includes configurations we needs for clustermanager in the Hosted mode. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--deploy_option--hosted))
- `mode` (String) Mode can be Default or Hosted. In Default mode, the Hub is installed as a whole and all parts of Hub are deployed in the same cluster. In Hosted mode, only crd and configurations are installed on one cluster(defined as hub-cluster). Controllers run in another cluster (defined as management-cluster) and connect to the hub with the kubeconfig in secret of 'external-hub-kubeconfig'(a kubeconfig of hub-cluster with cluster-admin permission). Note: Do not modify the Mode field once it's applied.

### Nested Schema for `spec.deploy_option.hosted`

Read-Only:

- `work_webhook_configuration` (Attributes) WorkWebhookConfiguration represents the customized webhook-server configuration of work. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--deploy_option--hosted--work_webhook_configuration))

### Nested Schema for `spec.deploy_option.hosted.work_webhook_configuration`

Read-Only:

- `address` (String) Address represents the address of a webhook-server. It could be in IP format or fqdn format. The Address must be reachable by apiserver of the hub cluster.
- `port` (Number) Port represents the port of a webhook-server. The default value of Port is 443.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--node_placement"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.node_placement`

Read-Only:

- `node_selector` (Map of String) NodeSelector defines which Nodes the Pods are scheduled on. The default is an empty list.
- `tolerations` (Attributes List) Tolerations is attached by pods to tolerate any taint that matches the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>. The default is an empty list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--node_placement--tolerations))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--node_placement--tolerations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.node_placement.tolerations`

Read-Only:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
- `value` (String) Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

### Nested Schema for `spec.registration_configuration`

Read-Only:

- `auto_approve_users` (List of String) AutoApproveUser represents a list of users that can auto approve CSR and accept client. If the credential of the bootstrap-hub-kubeconfig matches to the users, the cluster created by the bootstrap-hub-kubeconfig will be auto-registered into the hub cluster. This takes effect only when ManagedClusterAutoApproval feature gate is enabled.
- `feature_gates` (Attributes List) FeatureGates represents the list of feature gates for registration If it is set empty, default feature gates will be used. If it is set, featuregate/Foo is an example of one item in FeatureGates: 1. If featuregate/Foo does not exist, registration-operator will discard it 2.
