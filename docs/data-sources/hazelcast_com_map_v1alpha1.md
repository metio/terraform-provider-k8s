## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.
- `spec` (Attributes) MapSpec defines the desired state of Hazelcast Map Config (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Read-Only:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.

You can learn more at https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/events/object-events. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--entry_listeners))
- `event_journal` (Attributes) EventJournal specifies event journal configuration of the Map (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--event_journal))

- `map_store` (Attributes) Configuration options when you want to load/store the map entries from/to a persistent data store such as a relational database You can learn more at https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/data-structures/working-with-external-data (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--map_store))
- `max_idle_seconds` (Number) Maximum time in seconds for each entry to stay idle in the map. Entries that are idle for more than this time are evicted automatically. It can be updated.
- `name` (String) Name of the data structure config to be created. If empty, CR name will be used. It cannot be updated after the config is created successfully.
- `near_cache` (Attributes) InMemoryFormat specifies near cache configuration for map (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--near_cache))
- `persistence_enabled` (Boolean) When enabled, map data will be persisted. It cannot be updated after map config is created successfully.
- `time_to_live_seconds` (Number) Maximum time in seconds for each entry to stay in the map. If it is not 0, entries that are older than this time and not updated for this time are evicted automatically. It can be updated.
