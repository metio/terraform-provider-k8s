# k8s_karpenter_sh_node_claim_v1_manifest (Data Source)

NodeClaim is the Schema for the NodeClaims API

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_karpenter_sh_node_claim_v1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name = "some-name"
  }
  spec = {
    node_class_ref = {
      group = "some-group"
      kind  = "some-kind"
      name  = "some-name"
    }
    requirements = []
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) NodeClaimSpec describes the desired state of the NodeClaim (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `node_class_ref` (Attributes) NodeClassRef is a reference to an object that defines provider specific configuration (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--node_class_ref))
- `requirements` (Attributes List) Requirements are layered with GetLabels and applied to every node. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--requirements))

Optional:

- `expire_after` (String) ExpireAfter is the duration the controller will waitbefore terminating a node, measured from when the node is created. Thisis useful to implement features like eventually consistent node upgrade,memory leak protection, and disruption testing.
- `resources` (Attributes) Resources models the resource requirements for the NodeClaim to launch (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--resources))
- `startup_taints` (Attributes List) StartupTaints are taints that are applied to nodes upon startup which are expected to be removed automaticallywithin a short period of time, typically by a DaemonSet that tolerates the taint. These are commonly used bydaemonsets to allow initialization and enforce startup ordering.  StartupTaints are ignored for provisioningpurposes in that pods are not required to tolerate a StartupTaint in order to have nodes provisioned for them. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--startup_taints))
- `taints` (Attributes List) Taints will be applied to the NodeClaim's node. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--taints))
- `termination_grace_period` (String) TerminationGracePeriod is the maximum duration the controller will wait before forcefully deleting the pods on a node, measured from when deletion is first initiated.Warning: this feature takes precedence over a Pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds value, and bypasses any blocked PDBs or the karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt annotation.This field is intended to be used by cluster administrators to enforce that nodes can be cycled within a given time period.When set, drifted nodes will begin draining even if there are pods blocking eviction. Draining will respect PDBs and the do-not-disrupt annotation until the TGP is reached.Karpenter will preemptively delete pods so their terminationGracePeriodSeconds align with the node's terminationGracePeriod.If a pod would be terminated without being granted its full terminationGracePeriodSeconds prior to the node timeout,that pod will be deleted at T = node timeout - pod terminationGracePeriodSeconds.The feature can also be used to allow maximum time limits for long-running jobs which can delay node termination with preStop hooks.If left undefined, the controller will wait indefinitely for pods to be drained.

### Nested Schema for `spec.node_class_ref`

Required:

- `group` (String) API version of the referent
- `kind` (String) Kind of the referent; More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds'
- `name` (String) Name of the referent; More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names


<a id="nestedatt--spec--requirements"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.requirements`

Required:

- `key` (String) The label key that the selector applies to.
- `operator` (String) Represents a key's relationship to a set of values.Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist. Gt, and Lt.

Optional:

- `min_values` (Number) This field is ALPHA and can be dropped or replaced at any timeMinValues is the minimum number of unique values required to define the flexibility of the specific requirement.
- `values` (List of String) An array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn,the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist,the values array must be empty. If the operator is Gt or Lt, the valuesarray must have a single element, which will be interpreted as an integer.This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--resources"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.resources`

Optional:

- `requests` (Map of String) Requests describes the minimum required resources for the NodeClaim to launch

### Nested Schema for `spec.startup_taints`

Required:

- `effect` (String) Required. The effect of the taint on podsthat do not tolerate the taint.Valid effects are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Required. The taint key to be applied to a node.

Optional:

- `time_added` (String) TimeAdded represents the time at which the taint was added.It is only written for NoExecute taints.
- `value` (String) The taint value corresponding to the taint key.
