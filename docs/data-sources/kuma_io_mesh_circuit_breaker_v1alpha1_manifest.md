<a id="nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.from.default.outlier_detection.detectors`

Optional:

- `failure_percentage` (Attributes) Failure Percentage based outlier detection functions similarly to successrate detection, in that it relies on success rate data from each host ina cluster. However, rather than compare those values to the mean successrate of the cluster as a whole, they are compared to a flatuser-configured threshold. This threshold is configured via theoutlierDetection.failurePercentageThreshold field.The other configuration fields for failure percentage based detection aresimilar to the fields for success rate detection. As with success ratedetection, detection will not be performed for a host if its requestvolume over the aggregation interval is less than theoutlierDetection.detectors.failurePercentage.requestVolume value.Detection also will not be performed for a cluster if the number of hostswith the minimum required request volume in an interval is less than theoutlierDetection.detectors.failurePercentage.minimumHosts value. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors--failure_percentage))

(see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors--gateway_failures))
- `local_origin_failures` (Attributes) This detection type is enabled only whenoutlierDetection.splitExternalLocalOriginErrors is true and takes intoaccount only locally originated errors (timeout, reset, etc).If Envoy repeatedly cannot connect to an upstream host or communicationwith the upstream host is repeatedly interrupted, it will be ejected.Various locally originated problems are detected: timeout, TCP reset,ICMP errors, etc. This detection type is supported by http router andtcp proxy. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors--local_origin_failures))
- `success_rate` (Attributes) Success Rate based outlier detection aggregates success rate data fromevery host in a cluster. Then at given intervals ejects hosts based onstatistical outlier detection. Success Rate outlier detection will not becalculated for a host if its request volume over the aggregation intervalis less than the outlierDetection.detectors.successRate.requestVolumevalue.Moreover, detection will not be performed for a cluster if the number ofhosts with the minimum required request volume in an interval is lessthan the outlierDetection.detectors.successRate.minimumHosts value.In the default configuration mode(outlierDetection.splitExternalLocalOriginErrors is false) this detectiontype takes into account all types of errors: locally and externallyoriginated.In split mode (outlierDetection.splitExternalLocalOriginErrors is true),locally originated errors and externally originated (transaction) errorsare counted and treated separately. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors--success_rate))
- `total_failures` (Attributes) In the default mode (outlierDetection.splitExternalAndLocalErrors isfalse) this detection type takes into account all generated errors:locally originated and externally originated (transaction) errors.In split mode (outlierDetection.splitExternalLocalOriginErrors is true)this detection type takes into account only externally originated(transaction) errors, ignoring locally originated errors.If an upstream host is an HTTP-server, only 5xx types of error are takeninto account (see Consecutive Gateway Failure for exceptions).Properly formatted responses, even when they carry an operational error(like index not found, access denied) are not taken into account. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors--total_failures))

If the volume is lower than thissetting, failure percentage-based ejection will not be performed for thishost.
