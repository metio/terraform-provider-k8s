# k8s_chaos_mesh_org_jvm_chaos_v1alpha1_manifest (Data Source)

JVMChaos is the Schema for the jvmchaos API

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_chaos_mesh_org_jvm_chaos_v1alpha1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) JVMChaosSpec defines the desired state of JVMChaos (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `action` (String) Action defines the specific jvm chaos action. Supported action: latency;return;exception;stress;gc;ruleData
- `mode` (String) Mode defines the mode to run chaos action. Supported mode: one / all / fixed / fixed-percent / random-max-percent
- `selector` (Attributes) Selector is used to select pods that are used to inject chaos action. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--selector))

Optional:

- `class` (String) Java class
- `container_names` (List of String) ContainerNames indicates list of the name of affected container. If not set, the first container will be injected
- `cpu_count` (Number) the CPU core number needs to use, only set it when action is stress
- `database` (String) the match database default value is '', means match all database
- `duration` (String) Duration represents the duration of the chaos action
- `exception` (String) the exception which needs to throw for action 'exception' or the exception message needs to throw in action 'mysql'
- `latency` (Number) the latency duration for action 'latency', unit ms or the latency duration in action 'mysql'
- `mem_type` (String) the memory type needs to locate, only set it when action is stress, the value can be 'stack' or 'heap'
- `method` (String) the method in Java class
- `mysql_connector_version` (String) the version of mysql-connector-java, only support 5.X.X(set to '5') and 8.X.X(set to '8') now
- `name` (String) byteman rule name, should be unique, and will generate one if not set
- `pid` (Number) the pid of Java process which needs to attach

- `rule_data` (String) the byteman rule's data for action 'ruleData'
- `sql_type` (String) the match sql type default value is '', means match all SQL type. The value can be 'select', 'insert', 'update', 'delete', 'replace'.
- `table` (String) the match table default value is '', means match all table
- `value` (String) Value is required when the mode is set to 'FixedMode' / 'FixedPercentMode' / 'RandomMaxPercentMode'. If 'FixedMode', provide an integer of pods to do chaos action. If 'FixedPercentMode', provide a number from 0-100 to specify the percent of pods the server can do chaos action. IF 'RandomMaxPercentMode',  provide a number from 0-100 to specify the max percent of pods to do chaos action

### Nested Schema for `spec.selector`

Optional:

- `annotation_selectors` (Map of String) Map of string keys and values that can be used to select objects. A selector based on annotations.
- `expression_selectors` (Attributes List) a slice of label selector expressions that can be used to select objects. A list of selectors based on set-based label expressions. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--selector--expression_selectors))
- `field_selectors` (Map of String) Map of string keys and values that can be used to select objects. A selector based on fields.
- `label_selectors` (Map of String) Map of string keys and values that can be used to select objects. A selector based on labels.
- `namespaces` (List of String) Namespaces is a set of namespace to which objects belong.
- `node_selectors` (Map of String) Map of string keys and values that can be used to select nodes. Selector which must match a node's labels, and objects must belong to these selected nodes.
- `nodes` (List of String) Nodes is a set of node name and objects must belong to these nodes.

### Nested Schema for `spec.selector.expression_selectors`

Required:

- `key` (String) key is the label key that the selector applies to.
