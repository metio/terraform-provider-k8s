# k8s_hazelcast_com_map_v1alpha1_manifest (Data Source)

Map is the Schema for the maps API

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_hazelcast_com_map_v1alpha1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
  spec = {
    hazelcast_resource_name = "some-name"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `spec` (Attributes) MapSpec defines the desired state of Hazelcast Map Config (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.
