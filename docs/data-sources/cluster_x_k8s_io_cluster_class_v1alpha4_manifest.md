# k8s_cluster_x_k8s_io_cluster_class_v1alpha4_manifest (Data Source)

ClusterClass is a template which can be used to create managed topologies. Deprecated: This type will be removed in one of the next releases.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_cluster_x_k8s_io_cluster_class_v1alpha4_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) ClusterClassSpec describes the desired state of the ClusterClass. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `control_plane` (Attributes) ControlPlane is a reference to a local struct that holds the details for provisioning the Control Plane for the Cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--control_plane))
- `infrastructure` (Attributes) Infrastructure is a reference to a provider-specific template that holds the details for provisioning infrastructure specific cluster for the underlying provider. The underlying provider is responsible for the implementation of the template to an infrastructure cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--infrastructure))
- `workers` (Attributes) Workers describes the worker nodes for the cluster. It is a collection of node types which can be used to create the worker nodes of the cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--workers))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--control_plane"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.control_plane`

Required:

- `ref` (Attributes) Ref is a required reference to a custom resource offered by a provider. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--control_plane--ref))

Optional:

- `machine_infrastructure` (Attributes) MachineTemplate defines the metadata and infrastructure information for control plane machines. This field is supported if and only if the control plane provider template referenced above is Machine based and supports setting replicas. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--control_plane--machine_infrastructure))
- `metadata` (Attributes) Metadata is the metadata applied to the machines of the ControlPlane. At runtime this metadata is merged with the corresponding metadata from the topology. This field is supported if and only if the control plane provider template referenced is Machine based. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--control_plane--metadata))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--control_plane--ref"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.control_plane.ref`

Optional:

- `api_version` (String) API version of the referent.
- `field_path` (String) If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: 'spec.containers{name}' (where 'name' refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified 'spec.containers[2]' (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object.
- `kind` (String) Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `name` (String) Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names
- `namespace` (String) Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/
- `resource_version` (String) Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
- `uid` (String) UID of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids
