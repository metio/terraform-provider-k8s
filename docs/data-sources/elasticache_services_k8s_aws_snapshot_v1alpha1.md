### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) The API group of the requested resource.
- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.
- `kind` (String) The type of the requested resource.
- `spec` (Attributes) SnapshotSpec defines the desired state of Snapshot.  Represents a copy of an entire Redis cluster as of the time when the snapshot was taken. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))
