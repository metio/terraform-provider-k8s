# k8s_fluentd_fluent_io_fluentd_config_v1alpha1_manifest (Data Source)

FluentdConfig is the Schema for the fluentdconfigs API

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_fluentd_fluent_io_fluentd_config_v1alpha1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) FluentdConfigSpec defines the desired state of FluentdConfig (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `cluster_filter_selector` (Attributes) Select cluster filter plugins (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--cluster_filter_selector))
- `cluster_input_selector` (Attributes) Select cluster input plugins (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--cluster_input_selector))
- `cluster_output_selector` (Attributes) Select cluster output plugins (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--cluster_output_selector))
- `emit_mode` (String) Emit mode. If batch, the plugin will emit events per labels matched. Enum: record, batch. will make no effect if EnableFilterKubernetes is set false.
- `filter_selector` (Attributes) Select namespaced filter plugins (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--filter_selector))
- `input_selector` (Attributes) Select cluster input plugins (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--input_selector))
- `output_selector` (Attributes) Select namespaced output plugins (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--output_selector))
- `sticky_tags` (String) Sticky tags will match only one record from an event stream. The same tag will be treated the same way. will make no effect if EnableFilterKubernetes is set false.
- `watched_constainers` (List of String) A set of container names. Ignored if left empty.
- `watched_hosts` (List of String) A set of hosts. Ignored if left empty.
- `watched_labels` (Map of String) Use this field to filter the logs, will make no effect if EnableFilterKubernetes is set false.

### Nested Schema for `spec.cluster_filter_selector`

Optional:

- `match_expressions` (Attributes List) matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--cluster_filter_selector--match_expressions))
- `match_labels` (Map of String) matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.

### Nested Schema for `spec.cluster_filter_selector.match_expressions`

Required:
