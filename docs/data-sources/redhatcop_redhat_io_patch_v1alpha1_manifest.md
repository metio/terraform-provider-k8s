# k8s_redhatcop_redhat_io_patch_v1alpha1_manifest (Data Source)

Patch is the Schema for the patches API

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_redhatcop_redhat_io_patch_v1alpha1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) PatchSpec defines the desired state of Patch (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `patches` (Attributes) Patches is a list of patches that should be enforced at runtime. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--patches))
- `service_account_ref` (Attributes) ServiceAccountRef is the service account to be used to run the controllers associated with this configuration (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--service_account_ref))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--patches"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.patches`

Optional:

- `patch_template` (String) PatchTemplate is a go template that will be resolved using the SourceObjectRefs as parameters. The result must be a valid patch based on the pacth type and the target object.
- `patch_type` (String) PatchType is the type of patch to be applied, one of 'application/json-patch+json'''application/merge-patch+json','application/strategic-merge-patch+json','application/apply-patch+yaml' default:='application/strategic-merge-patch+json'
- `source_object_refs` (Attributes List) SourceObjectRefs is an arrays of refereces to source objects that will be used as input for the template processing. These refernces must resolve to single instance. The resolution rule is as follows (+ present, - absent): the King and APIVersion field are mandatory -Namespace +Name: resolves to cluster-level object <Name>. If Kind is namespaced, this results in an error. -Namespace -Name: results in an error Name manespaces Namespace are evaluated as golang templates with the input of the template being the target object. When selecting multiple target, this allows for having specific source objects for each target. ResourceVersion and UID are always ignored If FieldPath is specified, the restuned object is calculated from the path, so for example if FieldPath=.spec, the only the spec portion of the object is returned. The target object is always added as element zero of the array of the SourceObjectRefs (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--patches--source_object_refs))
- `target_object_ref` (Attributes) TargetObjectRef is a reference to the object to which the pacth should be applied. the King and APIVersion field are mandatory the Name and Namespace field have the following meaning (+ present, - absent) -Namespace +Name: apply the patch to the cluster-level object <Name>. If Kind is namespaced, this results in an error. -Namespace -Name: if the kind is namespaced apply the patch to all of the objects in all of the namespaces. If the kind is not namespaced, apply the patch to all of the cluster level objects. The lable selector can be used to further filter the selected objects. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--patches--target_object_ref))

### Nested Schema for `spec.patches.source_object_refs`

Optional:

- `api_version` (String) API version of the referent.
- `field_path` (String) If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: 'spec.containers{name}' (where 'name' refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified 'spec.containers[2]' (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object.
- `kind` (String) Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `name` (String) Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names
- `namespace` (String) Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/

Optional:

- `annotation_selector` (Attributes) AnnotationSelector selects objects by label (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--patches--target_object_ref--annotation_selector))
- `api_version` (String) API version of the referent.
- `kind` (String) Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector selects objects by label (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--patches--target_object_ref--label_selector))

- `match_labels` (Map of String) matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.
