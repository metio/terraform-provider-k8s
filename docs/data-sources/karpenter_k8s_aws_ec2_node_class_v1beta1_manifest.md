- `instance_profile` (String) InstanceProfile is the AWS entity that instances use.This field is mutually exclusive from role.The instance profile should already have a role assigned to it that Karpenter has PassRole permission on for instance launch using this instanceProfile to succeed.
- `instance_store_policy` (String) InstanceStorePolicy specifies how to handle instance-store disks.
- `metadata_options` (Attributes) MetadataOptions for the generated launch template of provisioned nodes.This specifies the exposure of the Instance Metadata Service toprovisioned EC2 nodes. For more information,see Instance Metadata and User Data(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html)in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.Refer to recommended, security best practices(https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/security/docs/iam/#restrict-access-to-the-instance-profile-assigned-to-the-worker-node)for limiting exposure of Instance Metadata and User Data to pods.If omitted, defaults to httpEndpoint enabled, with httpProtocolIPv6disabled, with httpPutResponseLimit of 1, and with httpTokensrequired. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--metadata_options))
- `role` (String) Role is the AWS identity that nodes use. This field is immutable.This field is mutually exclusive from instanceProfile.Marking this field as immutable avoids concerns around terminating managed instance profiles from running instances.This field may be made mutable in the future, assuming the correct garbage collection and drift handling is implementedfor the old instance profiles on an update.
- `tags` (Map of String) Tags to be applied on ec2 resources like instances and launch templates.
- `user_data` (String) UserData to be applied to the provisioned nodes.It must be in the appropriate format based on the AMIFamily in use. Karpenter will merge certain fields intothis UserData to ensure nodes are being provisioned with the correct configuration.

- `volume_type` (String) VolumeType of the block device.For more information, see Amazon EBS volume types (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html)in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.



<a id="nestedatt--spec--metadata_options"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.metadata_options`

Optional:

- `http_endpoint` (String) HTTPEndpoint enables or disables the HTTP metadata endpoint on provisionednodes. If metadata options is non-nil, but this parameter is not specified,the default state is 'enabled'.If you specify a value of 'disabled', instance metadata will not be accessibleon the node.
- `http_protocol_i_pv6` (String) HTTPProtocolIPv6 enables or disables the IPv6 endpoint for the instance metadataservice on provisioned nodes. If metadata options is non-nil, but this parameteris not specified, the default state is 'disabled'.
- `http_put_response_hop_limit` (Number) HTTPPutResponseHopLimit is the desired HTTP PUT response hop limit forinstance metadata requests. The larger the number, the further instancemetadata requests can travel. Possible values are integers from 1 to 64.If metadata options is non-nil, but this parameter is not specified, thedefault value is 2.
- `http_tokens` (String) HTTPTokens determines the state of token usage for instance metadatarequests. If metadata options is non-nil, but this parameter is notspecified, the default state is 'required'.If the state is optional, one can choose to retrieve instance metadata withor without a signed token header on the request. If one retrieves the IAMrole credentials without a token, the version 1.0 role credentials arereturned. If one retrieves the IAM role credentials using a valid signedtoken, the version 2.0 role credentials are returned.If the state is 'required', one must send a signed token header with anyinstance metadata retrieval requests. In this state, retrieving the IAMrole credentials always returns the version 2.0 credentials; the version1.0 credentials are not available.
