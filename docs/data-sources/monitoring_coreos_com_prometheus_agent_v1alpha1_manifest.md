# k8s_monitoring_coreos_com_prometheus_agent_v1alpha1_manifest (Data Source)

The 'PrometheusAgent' custom resource definition (CRD) defines a desired [Prometheus Agent](https://prometheus.io/blog/2021/11/16/agent/) setup to run in a Kubernetes cluster.The CRD is very similar to the 'Prometheus' CRD except for features which aren't available in agent mode like rule evaluation, persistent storage and Thanos sidecar.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_monitoring_coreos_com_prometheus_agent_v1alpha1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
  spec = {}
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) Specification of the desired behavior of the Prometheus agent. More info:https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `additional_args` (Attributes List) AdditionalArgs allows setting additional arguments for the 'prometheus' container.It is intended for e.g. activating hidden flags which are not supported bythe dedicated configuration options yet. The arguments are passed as-is to thePrometheus container which may cause issues if they are invalid or not supportedby the given Prometheus version.In case of an argument conflict (e.g. an argument which is already set by theoperator itself) or when providing an invalid argument, the reconciliation willfail and an error will be logged. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--additional_args))
- `additional_scrape_configs` (Attributes) AdditionalScrapeConfigs allows specifying a key of a Secret containingadditional Prometheus scrape configurations. Scrape configurationsspecified are appended to the configurations generated by the PrometheusOperator. Job configurations specified must have the form as specifiedin the official Prometheus documentation:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config.As scrape configs are appended, the user is responsible to make sure itis valid. Note that using this feature may expose the possibility tobreak upgrades of Prometheus. It is advised to review Prometheus releasenotes to ensure that no incompatible scrape configs are going to breakPrometheus after the upgrade. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--additional_scrape_configs))
- `affinity` (Attributes) Defines the Pods' affinity scheduling rules if specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--affinity))
- `apiserver_config` (Attributes) APIServerConfig allows specifying a host and auth methods to access theKuberntees API server.If null, Prometheus is assumed to run inside of the cluster: it willdiscover the API servers automatically and use the Pod's CA certificateand bearer token file at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--apiserver_config))
- `arbitrary_fs_access_through_s_ms` (Attributes) When true, ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor and Probe object are forbidden toreference arbitrary files on the file system of the 'prometheus'container.When a ServiceMonitor's endpoint specifies a 'bearerTokenFile' value(e.g.  '/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token'), amalicious target can get access to the Prometheus service account'stoken in the Prometheus' scrape request. Setting'spec.arbitraryFSAccessThroughSM' to 'true' would prevent the attack.Users should instead provide the credentials using the'spec.bearerTokenSecret' field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--arbitrary_fs_access_through_s_ms))
- `automount_service_account_token` (Boolean) AutomountServiceAccountToken indicates whether a service account token should be automatically mounted in the pod.If the field isn't set, the operator mounts the service account token by default.**Warning:** be aware that by default, Prometheus requires the service account token for Kubernetes service discovery.It is possible to use strategic merge patch to project the service account token into the 'prometheus' container.
- `body_size_limit` (String) BodySizeLimit defines per-scrape on response body size.Only valid in Prometheus versions 2.45.0 and newer.Note that the global limit only applies to scrape objects that don't specify an explicit limit value.If you want to enforce a maximum limit for all scrape objects, refer to enforcedBodySizeLimit.
- `config_maps` (List of String) ConfigMaps is a list of ConfigMaps in the same namespace as the Prometheusobject, which shall be mounted into the Prometheus Pods.Each ConfigMap is added to the StatefulSet definition as a volume named 'configmap-<configmap-name>'.The ConfigMaps are mounted into /etc/prometheus/configmaps/<configmap-name> in the 'prometheus' container.
- `containers` (Attributes List) Containers allows injecting additional containers or modifying operatorgenerated containers. This can be used to allow adding an authenticationproxy to the Pods or to change the behavior of an operator generatedcontainer. Containers described here modify an operator generatedcontainer if they share the same name and modifications are done via astrategic merge patch.The names of containers managed by the operator are:* 'prometheus'* 'config-reloader'* 'thanos-sidecar'Overriding containers is entirely outside the scope of what themaintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviourmay break at any time without notice. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--containers))
- `enable_features` (List of String) Enable access to Prometheus feature flags. By default, no features are enabled.Enabling features which are disabled by default is entirely outside thescope of what the maintainers will support and by doing so, you acceptthat this behaviour may break at any time without notice.For more information see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/
- `enable_remote_write_receiver` (Boolean) Enable Prometheus to be used as a receiver for the Prometheus remotewrite protocol.WARNING: This is not considered an efficient way of ingesting samples.Use it with caution for specific low-volume use cases.It is not suitable for replacing the ingestion via scraping and turningPrometheus into a push-based metrics collection system.For more information see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#remote-write-receiverIt requires Prometheus >= v2.33.0.

Once all regularcontainers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy 'Always'will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers andis often referred to as a 'sidecar' container. Although this initcontainer still starts in the init container sequence, it does not waitfor the container to complete before proceeding to the next initcontainer.

- `stdin` (Boolean) Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If thisis not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF.Default is false.
- `stdin_once` (Boolean) Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened bya single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attachsessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until thefirst client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects,at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If thisflag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF.Default is false
- `termination_message_path` (String) Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination messagewill be written is mounted into the container's filesystem.Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message.Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length acrossall containers will be limited to 12kb.Defaults to /dev/termination-log.Cannot be updated.
- `termination_message_policy` (String) Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents ofterminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure.FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the terminationmessage file is empty and the container exited with an error.The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller.Defaults to File.Cannot be updated.
- `tty` (Boolean) Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true.Default is false.

Once all regularcontainers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy 'Always'will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers andis often referred to as a 'sidecar' container.

- `stdin_once` (Boolean) Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened bya single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attachsessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until thefirst client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects,at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If thisflag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF.Default is false
- `termination_message_path` (String) Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination messagewill be written is mounted into the container's filesystem.Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message.Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length acrossall containers will be limited to 12kb.Defaults to /dev/termination-log.Cannot be updated.
- `termination_message_policy` (String) Indicate how the termination message should be populated.

### Nested Schema for `spec.storage.ephemeral`

Optional:

- `volume_claim_template` (Attributes) Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be theowner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with thepod.  The name of the PVC will be '<pod name>-<volume name>' where'<volume name>' is the name from the 'PodSpec.Volumes' arrayentry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated nameis not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the podwill *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelatedvolume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked untilthe unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC ismeant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with anowner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normallythis should not be necessary, but it may be useful whenmanually reconstructing a broken cluster.This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetesto the PVC after it has been created.Required, must not be nil.

Optional:

- `metadata` (Map of String) May contain labels and annotations that will be copied into the PVCwhen creating it. No other fields are allowed and will be rejected duringvalidation.

- `volume_attributes_class_name` (String) volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim.If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes definedin the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClasswill be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClasswill be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will beset to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resourceexists.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-attributes-classes/(Beta) Using this field requires the VolumeAttributesClass feature gate to be enabled (off by default).
- `volume_mode` (String) volumeMode defines what type of volume is required by the claim.Value of Filesystem is implied when not included in claim spec.
- `volume_name` (String) volumeName is the binding reference to the PersistentVolume backing this claim.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--tolerations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.tolerations`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod cantolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must beof effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero andnegative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
- `value` (String) Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--topology_spread_constraints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.topology_spread_constraints`

Required:

- `max_skew` (Number) MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.When 'whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule', it is the maximum permitted differencebetween the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domainor zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the samelabelSelector spread as 2/2/1:In this case, the global minimum is 1.| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 ||  P P  |  P P  |   P   |- if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)violate MaxSkew(1).- if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.When 'whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway', it is used to give higher precedenceto topologies that satisfy it.It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
- `topology_key` (String) TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this keyand identical values are considered to be in the same topology.We consider each <key, value> as a 'bucket', and try to put balanced numberof pods into each bucket.We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements ofnodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.e.g. If TopologyKey is 'kubernetes.io/hostname', each Node is a domain of that topology.And, if TopologyKey is 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', each zone is a domain of that topology.It's a required field.
- `when_unsatisfiable` (String) WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfythe spread constraint.- DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.- ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the  skew.A constraint is considered 'Unsatisfiable' for an incoming podif and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate'MaxSkew' on some topology.For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the samelabelSelector spread as 3/1/1:| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 || P P P |   P   |   P   |If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduledto zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfiesMaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but schedulerwon't make it *more* imbalanced.It's a required field.

Optional:

- `additional_label_selectors` (String) Defines what Prometheus Operator managed labels should be added to labelSelector on the topologySpreadConstraint.
- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector is used to find matching pods.Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of podsin their corresponding topology domain. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--topology_spread_constraints--label_selector))
- `match_label_keys` (List of String) MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over whichspreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from theincoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelectorto select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculatedfor the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels willbe ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `min_domains` (Number) MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,Pod Topology Spread treats 'global minimum' as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,this value has no effect on scheduling.As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.Valid values are integers greater than 0.When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the samelabelSelector spread as 2/2/2:| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 ||  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so 'global minimum' is treated as 0.In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,it will violate MaxSkew.
- `node_affinity_policy` (String) NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelectorwhen calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are:- Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations.- Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy.This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
- `node_taints_policy` (String) NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculatingpod topology spread skew. Options are:- Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming podhas a toleration, are included.- Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

### Nested Schema for `spec.volumes.ephemeral`

Optional:

- `volume_claim_template` (Attributes) Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be theowner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with thepod.  The name of the PVC will be '<pod name>-<volume name>' where'<volume name>' is the name from the 'PodSpec.Volumes' arrayentry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated nameis not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the podwill *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelatedvolume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked untilthe unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC ismeant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with anowner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normallythis should not be necessary, but it may be useful whenmanually reconstructing a broken cluster.This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetesto the PVC after it has been created.Required, must not be nil.

- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-emptyvolume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (noncore object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type ofthe specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamicprovisioner.This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as suchif both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwardscompatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the samevalue automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is  specified.* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects  in any namespaces.(Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.(Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

- `volume_attributes_class_name` (String) volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim.If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes definedin the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClasswill be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClasswill be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will beset to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resourceexists.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-attributes-classes/(Beta) Using this field requires the VolumeAttributesClass feature gate to be enabled (off by default).
- `volume_mode` (String) volumeMode defines what type of volume is required by the claim.Value of Filesystem is implied when not included in claim spec.
- `volume_name` (String) volumeName is the binding reference to the PersistentVolume backing this claim.
