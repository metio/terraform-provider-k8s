Challenge is a type to represent a Challenge request with an ACME server

data "k8s_acme_cert_manager_io_challenge_v1_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
  spec = {
    authorization_url = "https://example.com/auth"
    dns_name          = "some-name"

### Nested Schema for `spec.solver.http01.ingress.parent_refs`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name is the name of the referent.Support: Core

Optional:

- `group` (String) Group is the group of the referent.When unspecified, 'gateway.networking.k8s.io' is inferred.To set the core API group (such as for a 'Service' kind referent),Group must be explicitly set to '' (empty string).Support: Core
- `kind` (String) Kind is kind of the referent.There are two kinds of parent resources with 'Core' support:* Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)* Service (Mesh conformance profile, experimental, ClusterIP Services only)Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, this refersto the local namespace of the Route.Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespaceboundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitlyallowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides ageneric way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.<gateway:experimental:description>ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are 'producer'routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections fromany namespace to the Service.ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are'consumer' routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outboundconnections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for whichthe intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as aParentRef of the Route.</gateway:experimental:description>Support: Core
- `port` (Number) Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreteddifferently based on the type of parent resource.When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listenerslistening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(andselect this Route). It's not recommended to set 'Port' unless thenetworking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific portas opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Portand SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listenermust match both specified values.<gateway:experimental:description>When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in theService spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.</gateway:experimental:description>Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearlydocument how/if Port is interpreted.For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful aslong as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gatewaylisteners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachmentfrom the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfullyattached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.Support: Extended<gateway:experimental>
- `section_name` (String) SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In thefollowing resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:* Gateway: Listener Name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionNameare specified, the name and port of the selected listener must matchboth specified values.* Service: Port Name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionNameare specified, the name and port of the selected listener must matchboth specified values. Note that attaching Routes to Services as Parentsis part of experimental Mesh support and is not supported for any otherpurpose.Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName isinterpreted.When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if atleast one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gatewaylisteners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment fromthe referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfullyattached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, theRoute MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.Support: Core

The node that ismost preferred is the one with the greatest sum of weights, i.e.for each node that meets all of the scheduling requirements (resourcerequest, requiredDuringScheduling anti-affinity expressions, etc.),compute a sum by iterating through the elements of this field and adding'weight' to the sum if the node has pods which matches the corresponding podAffinityTerm; thenode(s) with the highest sum are the most preferred.

- `required_during_scheduling_ignored_during_execution` (Attributes List) If the anti-affinity requirements specified by this field are not met atscheduling time, the pod will not be scheduled onto the node.If the anti-affinity requirements specified by this field cease to be metat some point during pod execution (e.g. due to a pod label update), thesystem may or may not try to eventually evict the pod from its node.When there are multiple elements, the lists of nodes corresponding to eachpodAffinityTerm are intersected, i.e. all terms must be satisfied.
