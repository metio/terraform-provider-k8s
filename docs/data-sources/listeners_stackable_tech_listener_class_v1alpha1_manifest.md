## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) Defines a policy for how [Listeners](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/nightly/listener-operator/listener) should be exposed. Read the [ListenerClass documentation](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/nightly/listener-operator/listenerclass) for more information. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `service_type` (String) The method used to access the services.

Optional:

- `service_annotations` (Map of String) Annotations that should be added to the Service object.
- `service_external_traffic_policy` (String) 'externalTrafficPolicy' that should be set on the created ['Service'] objects. The default is 'Local' (in contrast to 'Cluster'), as we aim to direct traffic to a node running the workload and we should keep testing that as the primary configuration. Cluster is a fallback option for providers that break Local mode (IONOS so far).
