# k8s_kyverno_io_policy_exception_v2_manifest (Data Source)

PolicyException declares resources to be excluded from specified policies.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_kyverno_io_policy_exception_v2_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) Spec declares policy exception behaviors. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `exceptions` (Attributes List) Exceptions is a list policy/rules to be excluded (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--exceptions))
- `match` (Attributes) Match defines match clause used to check if a resource applies to the exception (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--match))

Optional:

- `conditions` (Attributes) Conditions are used to determine if a resource applies to the exception by evaluating a set of conditions. The declaration can contain nested 'any' or 'all' statements. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--conditions))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--exceptions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.exceptions`

Required:
