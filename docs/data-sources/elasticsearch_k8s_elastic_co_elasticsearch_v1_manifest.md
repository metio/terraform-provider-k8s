All invalid keyswill be reported as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists in multiplesources, the value associated with the last source will take precedence.Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence.Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--node_sets--pod_template--spec--containers--env_from))
- `image` (String) Container image name.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/imagesThis field is optional to allow higher level config management to default or overridecontainer images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.
- `image_pull_policy` (String) Image pull policy.One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent.Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.Cannot be updated.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images

- `stdin_once` (Boolean) Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened bya single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attachsessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until thefirst client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects,at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If thisflag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF.Default is false
- `termination_message_path` (String) Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination messagewill be written is mounted into the container's filesystem.Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message.Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length acrossall containers will be limited to 12kb.Defaults to /dev/termination-log.Cannot be updated.

- `stdin_once` (Boolean) Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened bya single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attachsessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until thefirst client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects,at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If thisflag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF.Default is false
- `termination_message_path` (String) Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination messagewill be written is mounted into the container's filesystem.Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message.Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes.

- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must beof effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero andnegative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--node_sets--pod_template--spec--topology_spread_constraints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.node_sets.pod_template.spec.topology_spread_constraints`

Required:

- `max_skew` (Number) MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.When 'whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule', it is the maximum permitted differencebetween the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domainor zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the samelabelSelector spread as 2/2/1:In this case, the global minimum is 1.| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 ||  P P  |  P P  |   P   |- if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)violate MaxSkew(1).- if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.When 'whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway', it is used to give higher precedenceto topologies that satisfy it.It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
- `topology_key` (String) TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this keyand identical values are considered to be in the same topology.We consider each <key, value> as a 'bucket', and try to put balanced numberof pods into each bucket.We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements ofnodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.e.g. If TopologyKey is 'kubernetes.io/hostname', each Node is a domain of that topology.And, if TopologyKey is 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', each zone is a domain of that topology.It's a required field.
- `when_unsatisfiable` (String) WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfythe spread constraint.- DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.- ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the  skew.A constraint is considered 'Unsatisfiable' for an incoming podif and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate'MaxSkew' on some topology.For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the samelabelSelector spread as 3/1/1:| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 || P P P |   P   |   P   |If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduledto zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfiesMaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but schedulerwon't make it *more* imbalanced.It's a required field.

Optional:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector is used to find matching pods.Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of podsin their corresponding topology domain. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--node_sets--pod_template--spec--topology_spread_constraints--label_selector))
- `match_label_keys` (List of String) MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over whichspreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from theincoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelectorto select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculatedfor the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels willbe ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `min_domains` (Number) MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,Pod Topology Spread treats 'global minimum' as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,this value has no effect on scheduling.As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.Valid values are integers greater than 0.When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the samelabelSelector spread as 2/2/2:| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 ||  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so 'global minimum' is treated as 0.In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,it will violate MaxSkew.This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `node_affinity_policy` (String) NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelectorwhen calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are:- Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations.- Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy.This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
- `node_taints_policy` (String) NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculatingpod topology spread skew. Options are:- Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming podhas a toleration, are included.- Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

Optional:

- `volume_claim_template` (Attributes) Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be theowner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with thepod.  The name of the PVC will be '<pod name>-<volume name>' where'<volume name>' is the name from the 'PodSpec.Volumes' arrayentry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated nameis not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the podwill *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelatedvolume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked untilthe unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC ismeant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with anowner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normallythis should not be necessary, but it may be useful whenmanually reconstructing a broken cluster.This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetesto the PVC after it has been created.Required, must not be nil.

Optional:

- `metadata` (Attributes) May contain labels and annotations that will be copied into the PVCwhen creating it. No other fields are allowed and will be rejected duringvalidation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--node_sets--pod_template--spec--volumes--vsphere_volume--volume_claim_template--metadata))

### Nested Schema for `spec.node_sets.pod_template.spec.volumes.vsphere_volume.volume_claim_template.spec`

Optional:

- `access_modes` (List of String) accessModes contains the desired access modes the volume should have.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1
- `data_source` (Attributes) dataSource field can be used to specify either:* An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot)* An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--node_sets--pod_template--spec--volumes--vsphere_volume--volume_claim_template--metadata--data_source))
- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-emptyvolume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (noncore object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type ofthe specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamicprovisioner.This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as suchif both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwardscompatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the samevalue automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is  specified.* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects  in any namespaces.(Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.(Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

- `storage_class_name` (String) storageClassName is the name of the StorageClass required by the claim.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1
- `volume_attributes_class_name` (String) volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim.If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes definedin the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClasswill be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClasswill be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will beset to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resourceexists.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#volumeattributesclass(Alpha) Using this field requires the VolumeAttributesClass feature gate to be enabled.
- `volume_mode` (String) volumeMode defines what type of volume is required by the claim.Value of Filesystem is implied when not included in claim spec.
- `volume_name` (String) volumeName is the binding reference to the PersistentVolume backing this claim.

- `data_source` (Attributes) dataSource field can be used to specify either:* An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot)* An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--node_sets--volume_claim_templates--status--data_source))
- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-emptyvolume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (noncore object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type ofthe specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamicprovisioner.This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as suchif both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwardscompatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the samevalue automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is  specified.* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects  in any namespaces.(Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.(Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

- `storage_class_name` (String) storageClassName is the name of the StorageClass required by the claim.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1
- `volume_attributes_class_name` (String) volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim.If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes definedin the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClasswill be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClasswill be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will beset to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resourceexists.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#volumeattributesclass(Alpha) Using this field requires the VolumeAttributesClass feature gate to be enabled.

Valid values are either:	* Un-prefixed keys:		- storage - the capacity of the volume.	* Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as 'example.com/my-custom-resource'Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io prefix are consideredreserved and hence may not be used.ClaimResourceStatus can be in any of following states:	- ControllerResizeInProgress:		State set when resize controller starts resizing the volume in control-plane.	- ControllerResizeFailed:		State set when resize has failed in resize controller with a terminal error.	- NodeResizePending:		State set when resize controller has finished resizing the volume but further resizing of		volume is needed on the node.	- NodeResizeInProgress:		State set when kubelet starts resizing the volume.	- NodeResizeFailed:		State set when resizing has failed in kubelet with a terminal error. Transient errors don't set		NodeResizeFailed.For example: if expanding a PVC for more capacity - this field can be one of the following states:	- pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = 'ControllerResizeInProgress'     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = 'ControllerResizeFailed'     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = 'NodeResizePending'     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = 'NodeResizeInProgress'     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = 'NodeResizeFailed'When this field is not set, it means that no resize operation is in progress for the given PVC.A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName or ClaimResourceStatusshould ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For example - a controller thatonly is responsible for resizing capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates that change other validresources associated with PVC.This is an alpha field and requires enabling RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature.
- `allocated_resources` (Map of String) allocatedResources tracks the resources allocated to a PVC including its capacity.Key names follow standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are either:	* Un-prefixed keys:		- storage - the capacity of the volume.	* Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as 'example.com/my-custom-resource'Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io prefix are consideredreserved and hence may not be used.Capacity reported here may be larger than the actual capacity when a volume expansion operationis requested.For storage quota, the larger value from allocatedResources and PVC.spec.resources is used.If allocatedResources is not set, PVC.spec.resources alone is used for quota calculation.If a volume expansion capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources is onlylowered if there are no expansion operations in progress and if the actual volume capacityis equal or lower than the requested capacity.A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceNameshould ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For example - a controller thatonly is responsible for resizing capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates that change other validresources associated with PVC.This is an alpha field and requires enabling RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature.
- `capacity` (Map of String) capacity represents the actual resources of the underlying volume.

### Nested Schema for `spec.http.service.spec`

Optional:

- `allocate_load_balancer_node_ports` (Boolean) allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts defines if NodePorts will be automaticallyallocated for services with type LoadBalancer.  Default is 'true'. Itmay be set to 'false' if the cluster load-balancer does not rely onNodePorts.  If the caller requests specific NodePorts (by specifying avalue), those requests will be respected, regardless of this field.This field may only be set for services with type LoadBalancer and willbe cleared if the type is changed to any other type.
- `cluster_i_ps` (List of String) ClusterIPs is a list of IP addresses assigned to this service, and areusually assigned randomly.  If an address is specified manually, isin-range (as per system configuration), and is not in use, it will beallocated to the service; otherwise creation of the service will fail.This field may not be changed through updates unless the type field isalso being changed to ExternalName (which requires this field to beempty) or the type field is being changed from ExternalName (in whichcase this field may optionally be specified, as describe above).  Validvalues are 'None', empty string (''), or a valid IP address.  Settingthis to 'None' makes a 'headless service' (no virtual IP), which isuseful when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying isnot required.  Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, andLoadBalancer. If this field is specified when creating a Service of typeExternalName, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updatinga Service to type ExternalName.  If this field is not specified, it willbe initialized from the clusterIP field.  If this field is specified,clients must ensure that clusterIPs[0] and clusterIP have the samevalue.This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack IPs, in either order).These IPs must correspond to the values of the ipFamilies field. BothclusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `cluster_ip` (String) clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assignedrandomly. If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as persystem configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to theservice; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field may notbe changed through updates unless the type field is also being changedto ExternalName (which requires this field to be blank) or the typefield is being changed from ExternalName (in which case this field mayoptionally be specified, as describe above).  Valid values are 'None',empty string (''), or a valid IP address. Setting this to 'None' makes a'headless service' (no virtual IP), which is useful when direct endpointconnections are preferred and proxying is not required.  Only applies totypes ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specifiedwhen creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. Thisfield will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `external_i_ps` (List of String) externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the clusterwill also accept traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed byKubernetes.  The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrivesat a node with this IP.  A common example is external load-balancersthat are not part of the Kubernetes system.
- `external_name` (String) externalName is the external reference that discovery mechanisms willreturn as an alias for this service (e.g. a DNS CNAME record). Noproxying will be involved.  Must be a lowercase RFC-1123 hostname(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires 'type' to be 'ExternalName'.
- `external_traffic_policy` (String) externalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic theyreceive on one of the Service's 'externally-facing' addresses (NodePorts,ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to 'Local', the proxy will configurethe service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take careof balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will delivertraffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masqueradingthe client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints willbe dropped.) The default value, 'Cluster', uses the standard behavior ofrouting to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and otherfeatures). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP fromwithin the cluster will always get 'Cluster' semantics, but clients sending toa NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into accountwhen picking a node.
- `health_check_node_port` (Number) healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service.This only applies when type is set to LoadBalancer andexternalTrafficPolicy is set to Local. If a value is specified, isin-range, and is not in use, it will be used.  If not specified, a valuewill be automatically allocated.  External systems (e.g. load-balancers)can use this port to determine if a given node holds endpoints for thisservice or not.  If this field is specified when creating a Servicewhich does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wipedwhen updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type).This field cannot be updated once set.
- `internal_traffic_policy` (String) InternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic theyreceive on the ClusterIP. If set to 'Local', the proxy will assume that podsonly want to talk to endpoints of the service on the same node as the pod,dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value,'Cluster', uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly(possibly modified by topology and other features).
- `ip_families` (List of String) IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to thisservice. This field is usually assigned automatically based on clusterconfiguration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If this field is specifiedmanually, the requested family is available in the cluster,and ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation ofthe service will fail. This field is conditionally mutable: it allowsfor adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not allowchanging the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are 'IPv4'and 'IPv6'.  This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP,NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to 'headless' services.This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, ineither order).  These families must correspond to the values of theclusterIPs field, if specified. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies aregoverned by the ipFamilyPolicy field.
- `ip_family_policy` (String) IPFamilyPolicy represents the dual-stack-ness requested or required bythis Service. If there is no value provided, then this field will be setto SingleStack. Services can be 'SingleStack' (a single IP family),'PreferDualStack' (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters ora single IP family on single-stack clusters), or 'RequireDualStack'(two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters, otherwise fail). TheipFamilies and clusterIPs fields depend on the value of this field. Thisfield will be wiped when updating a service to type ExternalName.
- `load_balancer_class` (String) loadBalancerClass is the class of the load balancer implementation this Service belongs to.If specified, the value of this field must be a label-style identifier, with an optional prefix,e.g. 'internal-vip' or 'example.com/internal-vip'. Unprefixed names are reserved for end-users.This field can only be set when the Service type is 'LoadBalancer'. If not set, the default loadbalancer implementation is used, today this is typically done through the cloud provider integration,but should apply for any default implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancerimplementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancerimplementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field.This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type 'LoadBalancer'.Once set, it can not be changed. This field will be wiped when a service is updated to a non 'LoadBalancer' type.
- `load_balancer_ip` (String) Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer.This feature depends on whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifyingthe loadBalancerIP when a load balancer is created.This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.Deprecated: This field was under-specified and its meaning varies across implementations.Using it is non-portable and it may not support dual-stack.Users are encouraged to use implementation-specific annotations when available.
- `load_balancer_source_ranges` (List of String) If specified and supported by the platform, this will restrict traffic through the cloud-providerload-balancer will be restricted to the specified client IPs. This field will be ignored if thecloud-provider does not support the feature.'More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/
- `ports` (Attributes List) The list of ports that are exposed by this service.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--http--service--spec--ports))
- `publish_not_ready_addresses` (Boolean) publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints for thisService should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready.The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service topropagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery.The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources forServices interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered 'ready' even if thePods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpointsthrough the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.
- `selector` (Map of String) Route service traffic to pods with label keys and values matching thisselector. If empty or not present, the service is assumed to have anexternal process managing its endpoints, which Kubernetes will notmodify. Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.Ignored if type is ExternalName.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/
- `session_affinity` (String) Supports 'ClientIP' and 'None'. Used to maintain session affinity.Enable client IP based session affinity.Must be ClientIP or None.Defaults to None.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `session_affinity_config` (Attributes) sessionAffinityConfig contains the configurations of session affinity. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--http--service--spec--session_affinity_config))
- `type` (String) type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Validoptions are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.'ClusterIP' allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancingto endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is notspecified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object orEndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is 'None', no virtual IP isallocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints ratherthan a virtual IP.'NodePort' builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node whichroutes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.'LoadBalancer' builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer(if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpointsas the clusterIP.'ExternalName' aliases this service to the specified externalName.Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types

Optional:

- `max_unavailable` (String) An eviction is allowed if at most 'maxUnavailable' pods selected by'selector' are unavailable after the eviction, i.e. even in absence ofthe evicted pod. For example, one can prevent all voluntary evictionsby specifying 0. This is a mutually exclusive setting with 'minAvailable'.
- `min_available` (String) An eviction is allowed if at least 'minAvailable' pods selected by'selector' will still be available after the eviction, i.e. even in theabsence of the evicted pod.  So for example you can prevent all voluntaryevictions by specifying '100%'.

- `unhealthy_pod_eviction_policy` (String) UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy defines the criteria for when unhealthy podsshould be considered for eviction. Current implementation considers healthy pods,as pods that have status.conditions item with type='Ready',status='True'.Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow.If no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used,which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy.IfHealthyBudget policy means that running pods (status.phase='Running'),but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is notdisrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal to status.desiredHealthy).Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.AlwaysAllow policy means that all running pods (status.phase='Running'),but not yet healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardlessof whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective runningpods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy.Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.Additional policies may be added in the future.Clients making eviction decisions should disallow eviction of unhealthy podsif they encounter an unrecognized policy in this field.This field is beta-level. The eviction API uses this field whenthe feature gate PDBUnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy is enabled (enabled by default).

<a id="nestedatt--spec--transport--service--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.transport.service.spec`

Optional:

- `allocate_load_balancer_node_ports` (Boolean) allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts defines if NodePorts will be automaticallyallocated for services with type LoadBalancer.  Default is 'true'. Itmay be set to 'false' if the cluster load-balancer does not rely onNodePorts.  If the caller requests specific NodePorts (by specifying avalue), those requests will be respected, regardless of this field.This field may only be set for services with type LoadBalancer and willbe cleared if the type is changed to any other type.
- `cluster_i_ps` (List of String) ClusterIPs is a list of IP addresses assigned to this service, and areusually assigned randomly.  If an address is specified manually, isin-range (as per system configuration), and is not in use, it will beallocated to the service; otherwise creation of the service will fail.This field may not be changed through updates unless the type field isalso being changed to ExternalName (which requires this field to beempty) or the type field is being changed from ExternalName (in whichcase this field may optionally be specified, as describe above).  Validvalues are 'None', empty string (''), or a valid IP address.  Settingthis to 'None' makes a 'headless service' (no virtual IP), which isuseful when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying isnot required.  Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, andLoadBalancer. If this field is specified when creating a Service of typeExternalName, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updatinga Service to type ExternalName.  If this field is not specified, it willbe initialized from the clusterIP field.  If this field is specified,clients must ensure that clusterIPs[0] and clusterIP have the samevalue.This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack IPs, in either order).These IPs must correspond to the values of the ipFamilies field. BothclusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `cluster_ip` (String) clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assignedrandomly. If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as persystem configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to theservice; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field may notbe changed through updates unless the type field is also being changedto ExternalName (which requires this field to be blank) or the typefield is being changed from ExternalName (in which case this field mayoptionally be specified, as describe above).  Valid values are 'None',empty string (''), or a valid IP address. Setting this to 'None' makes a'headless service' (no virtual IP), which is useful when direct endpointconnections are preferred and proxying is not required.  Only applies totypes ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specifiedwhen creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. Thisfield will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `external_i_ps` (List of String) externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the clusterwill also accept traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed byKubernetes.  The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrivesat a node with this IP.  A common example is external load-balancersthat are not part of the Kubernetes system.
- `external_name` (String) externalName is the external reference that discovery mechanisms willreturn as an alias for this service (e.g. a DNS CNAME record). Noproxying will be involved.  Must be a lowercase RFC-1123 hostname(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires 'type' to be 'ExternalName'.
- `external_traffic_policy` (String) externalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic theyreceive on one of the Service's 'externally-facing' addresses (NodePorts,ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to 'Local', the proxy will configurethe service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take careof balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will delivertraffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masqueradingthe client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints willbe dropped.) The default value, 'Cluster', uses the standard behavior ofrouting to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and otherfeatures). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP fromwithin the cluster will always get 'Cluster' semantics, but clients sending toa NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into accountwhen picking a node.
- `health_check_node_port` (Number) healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service.This only applies when type is set to LoadBalancer andexternalTrafficPolicy is set to Local. If a value is specified, isin-range, and is not in use, it will be used.  If not specified, a valuewill be automatically allocated.  External systems (e.g. load-balancers)can use this port to determine if a given node holds endpoints for thisservice or not.  If this field is specified when creating a Servicewhich does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wipedwhen updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type).This field cannot be updated once set.
- `internal_traffic_policy` (String) InternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic theyreceive on the ClusterIP. If set to 'Local', the proxy will assume that podsonly want to talk to endpoints of the service on the same node as the pod,dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value,'Cluster', uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly(possibly modified by topology and other features).
- `ip_families` (List of String) IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to thisservice. This field is usually assigned automatically based on clusterconfiguration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If this field is specifiedmanually, the requested family is available in the cluster,and ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation ofthe service will fail. This field is conditionally mutable: it allowsfor adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not allowchanging the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are 'IPv4'and 'IPv6'.  This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP,NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to 'headless' services.This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, ineither order).  These families must correspond to the values of theclusterIPs field, if specified. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies aregoverned by the ipFamilyPolicy field.
- `ip_family_policy` (String) IPFamilyPolicy represents the dual-stack-ness requested or required bythis Service. If there is no value provided, then this field will be setto SingleStack. Services can be 'SingleStack' (a single IP family),'PreferDualStack' (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters ora single IP family on single-stack clusters), or 'RequireDualStack'(two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters, otherwise fail). TheipFamilies and clusterIPs fields depend on the value of this field. Thisfield will be wiped when updating a service to type ExternalName.
- `load_balancer_class` (String) loadBalancerClass is the class of the load balancer implementation this Service belongs to.If specified, the value of this field must be a label-style identifier, with an optional prefix,e.g. 'internal-vip' or 'example.com/internal-vip'. Unprefixed names are reserved for end-users.This field can only be set when the Service type is 'LoadBalancer'. If not set, the default loadbalancer implementation is used, today this is typically done through the cloud provider integration,but should apply for any default implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancerimplementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancerimplementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field.This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type 'LoadBalancer'.Once set, it can not be changed. This field will be wiped when a service is updated to a non 'LoadBalancer' type.
- `load_balancer_ip` (String) Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer.This feature depends on whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifyingthe loadBalancerIP when a load balancer is created.This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.Deprecated: This field was under-specified and its meaning varies across implementations.Using it is non-portable and it may not support dual-stack.Users are encouraged to use implementation-specific annotations when available.
- `load_balancer_source_ranges` (List of String) If specified and supported by the platform, this will restrict traffic through the cloud-providerload-balancer will be restricted to the specified client IPs. This field will be ignored if thecloud-provider does not support the feature.'More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/
- `ports` (Attributes List) The list of ports that are exposed by this service.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--transport--service--spec--ports))
- `publish_not_ready_addresses` (Boolean) publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints for thisService should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready.The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service topropagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery.The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources forServices interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered 'ready' even if thePods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpointsthrough the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.
- `selector` (Map of String) Route service traffic to pods with label keys and values matching thisselector. If empty or not present, the service is assumed to have anexternal process managing its endpoints, which Kubernetes will notmodify. Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.Ignored if type is ExternalName.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/
- `session_affinity` (String) Supports 'ClientIP' and 'None'. Used to maintain session affinity.Enable client IP based session affinity.Must be ClientIP or None.Defaults to None.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `session_affinity_config` (Attributes) sessionAffinityConfig contains the configurations of session affinity. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--transport--service--spec--session_affinity_config))
- `type` (String) type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Validoptions are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.'ClusterIP' allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancingto endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is notspecified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object orEndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is 'None', no virtual IP isallocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints ratherthan a virtual IP.'NodePort' builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node whichroutes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.'LoadBalancer' builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer(if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpointsas the clusterIP.'ExternalName' aliases this service to the specified externalName.Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types

### Nested Schema for `spec.transport.service.spec.ports`

Required:

- `port` (Number) The port that will be exposed by this service.

Optional:

- `app_protocol` (String) The application protocol for this port.This is used as a hint for implementations to offer richer behavior for protocols that they understand.This field follows standard Kubernetes label syntax.Valid values are either:* Un-prefixed protocol names - reserved for IANA standard service names (as perRFC-6335 and https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names).* Kubernetes-defined prefixed names:  * 'kubernetes.io/h2c' - HTTP/2 prior knowledge over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html#name-starting-http-2-with-prior-  * 'kubernetes.io/ws'  - WebSocket over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455  * 'kubernetes.io/wss' - WebSocket over TLS as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455* Other protocols should use implementation-defined prefixed names such asmycompany.com/my-custom-protocol.
- `name` (String) The name of this port within the service. This must be a DNS_LABEL.All ports within a ServiceSpec must have unique names. When consideringthe endpoints for a Service, this must match the 'name' field in theEndpointPort.Optional if only one ServicePort is defined on this service.
- `node_port` (Number) The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type isNodePort or LoadBalancer.  Usually assigned by the system. If a value isspecified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise theoperation will fail.  If not specified, a port will be allocated if thisService requires one.  If this field is specified when creating aService which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will bewiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing typefrom NodePort to ClusterIP).More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport
- `protocol` (String) The IP protocol for this port. Supports 'TCP', 'UDP', and 'SCTP'.Default is TCP.
- `target_port` (String) Number or name of the port to access on the pods targeted by the service.Number must be in the range 1 to 65535. Name must be an IANA_SVC_NAME.If this is a string, it will be looked up as a named port in thetarget Pod's container ports. If this is not specified, the valueof the 'port' field is used (an identity map).This field is ignored for services with clusterIP=None, and should beomitted or set equal to the 'port' field.More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#defining-a-service
