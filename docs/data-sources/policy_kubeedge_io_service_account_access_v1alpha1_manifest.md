- `image_pull_secrets` (Attributes List) ImagePullSecrets is a list of references to secrets in the same namespace to use for pulling any images in pods that reference this ServiceAccount. ImagePullSecrets are distinct from Secrets because Secrets can be mounted in the pod, but ImagePullSecrets are only accessed by the kubelet.

Pods are only limited to this list if this service account has a 'kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets' annotation set to 'true'. This field should not be used to find auto-generated service account token secrets for use outside of pods. Instead, tokens can be requested directly using the TokenRequest API, or service account token secrets can be manually created.

### Nested Schema for `spec.service_account.image_pull_secrets`

Optional:

### Nested Schema for `spec.service_account.secrets`

Optional:

- `api_version` (String) API version of the referent.
- `field_path` (String) If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: 'spec.containers{name}' (where 'name' refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified 'spec.containers[2]' (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future.

- `namespace` (String) Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/
- `resource_version` (String) Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
- `uid` (String) UID of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids
