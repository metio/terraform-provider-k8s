<a id="nestedatt--spec--service_import"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.service_import`

Optional:

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `metadata` (Map of String)

<a id="nestedatt--spec--service_import--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.service_import.spec`

Required:

- `ports` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--service_import--spec--ports))
- `type` (String) type defines the type of this service. Must be ClusterSetIP or Headless.

Optional:

- `ips` (List of String) ip will be used as the VIP for this service when type is ClusterSetIP.
- `session_affinity` (String) Supports 'ClientIP' and 'None'. Used to maintain session affinity. Enable client IP based session affinity. Must be ClientIP or None. Defaults to None. Ignored when type is Headless More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `session_affinity_config` (Attributes) sessionAffinityConfig contains session affinity configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--service_import--spec--session_affinity_config))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--service_import--spec--ports"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.service_import.spec.session_affinity_config`

Required:

- `port` (Number) The port that will be exposed by this service.

Optional:

- `app_protocol` (String) The application protocol for this port. This field follows standard Kubernetes label syntax. Un-prefixed names are reserved for IANA standard service names (as per RFC-6335 and http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names). Non-standard protocols should use prefixed names such as mycompany.com/my-custom-protocol. Field can be enabled with ServiceAppProtocol feature gate.
- `name` (String) The name of this port within the service. This must be a DNS_LABEL. All ports within a ServiceSpec must have unique names. When considering the endpoints for a Service, this must match the 'name' field in the EndpointPort. Optional if only one ServicePort is defined on this service.
- `protocol` (String) The IP protocol for this port. Supports 'TCP', 'UDP', and 'SCTP'. Default is TCP.
