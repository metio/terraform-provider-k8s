## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.
- `spec` (Attributes) RepositorySpec defines the desired state of Repository.  An object representing a repository. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Read-Only:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Read-Only:

- `encryption_configuration` (Attributes) The encryption configuration for the repository. This determines how the contents of your repository are encrypted at rest. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--encryption_configuration))
- `image_scanning_configuration` (Attributes) The image scanning configuration for the repository. This determines whether images are scanned for known vulnerabilities after being pushed to the repository. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--image_scanning_configuration))
- `image_tag_mutability` (String) The tag mutability setting for the repository. If this parameter is omitted, the default setting of MUTABLE will be used which will allow image tags to be overwritten. If IMMUTABLE is specified, all image tags within the repository will be immutable which will prevent them from being overwritten.
- `lifecycle_policy` (String) The JSON repository policy text to apply to the repository.
- `name` (String) The name to use for the repository. The repository name may be specified on its own (such as nginx-web-app) or it can be prepended with a namespace to group the repository into a category (such as project-a/nginx-web-app).
- `policy` (String) The JSON repository policy text to apply to the repository. For more information, see Amazon ECR repository policies (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/repository-policy-examples.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide.
- `registry_id` (String) The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry to create the repository. If you do not specify a registry, the default registry is assumed.
- `tags` (Attributes List) The metadata that you apply to the repository to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128 characters, and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--tags))
