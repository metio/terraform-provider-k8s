# k8s_redhatcop_redhat_io_user_config_v1alpha1 (Data Source)

UserConfig is the Schema for the userconfigs API

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_redhatcop_redhat_io_user_config_v1alpha1" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name = "some-name"

  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.name`.
- `spec` (Attributes) UserConfigSpec defines the desired state of UserConfig There are four selectors: 'labelSelector', 'annotationSelector', 'identityExtraFieldSelector' and 'providerName'. labelSelector and annoationSelector are matches against the User object identityExtraFieldSelector and providerName are matched against any of the Identities associated with User Selectors are considered in AND, so if multiple are defined tthey must all be true for a User to be selected. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Read-Only:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Read-Only:

- `annotation_selector` (Attributes) AnnotationSelector selects Users by annotation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--annotation_selector))
- `identity_extra_field_selector` (Attributes) IdentityExtraSelector allows you to specify a selector for the extra fields of the User's identities. If one of the user identities matches the selector the User is selected This condition is in OR with ProviderName (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--identity_extra_field_selector))
- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector selects Users by label. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--label_selector))
- `provider_name` (String) ProviderName allows you to specify an identity provider. If a user logged in with that provider it is selected. This condition is in OR with IdentityExtraSelector
- `templates` (Attributes List) Templates these are the templates of the resources to be created when a selected user is created/updated (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--templates))

### Nested Schema for `spec.annotation_selector`

Read-Only:

- `match_expressions` (Attributes List) matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--annotation_selector--match_expressions))
- `match_labels` (Map of String) matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.

### Nested Schema for `spec.annotation_selector.match_expressions`

Read-Only:

- `key` (String) key is the label key that the selector applies to.
- `operator` (String) operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.
- `values` (List of String) values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.
