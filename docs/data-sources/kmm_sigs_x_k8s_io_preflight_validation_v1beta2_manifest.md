PreflightValidation initiates a preflight validations for all Modules on the current Kubernetes cluster.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "k8s_kmm_sigs_x_k8s_io_preflight_validation_v1beta2_manifest" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name = "some-name"
  }
  spec = {
    kernel_version = "some-version"
  }
}
```

- `spec` (Attributes) PreflightValidationSpec describes the desired state of the resource, such as the kernel version that Module CRs need to be verified against as well as the debug configuration of the logs More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only
