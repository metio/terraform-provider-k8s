## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) PGAdminSpec defines the desired state of PGAdmin (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `data_volume_claim_spec` (Attributes) Defines a PersistentVolumeClaim for pgAdmin data. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--data_volume_claim_spec))

Optional:

- `affinity` (Attributes) Scheduling constraints of the PGAdmin pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--affinity))
- `config` (Attributes) Configuration settings for the pgAdmin process. Changes to any of these values will be loaded without validation. Be careful, as you may put pgAdmin into an unusable state. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--config))
- `image` (String) The image name to use for pgAdmin instance.
- `image_pull_policy` (String) ImagePullPolicy is used to determine when Kubernetes will attempt to pull (download) container images. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#image-pull-policy
- `image_pull_secrets` (Attributes List) The image pull secrets used to pull from a private registry. Changing this value causes all running PGAdmin pods to restart. https://k8s.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/ (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--image_pull_secrets))
- `metadata` (Attributes) Metadata contains metadata for custom resources (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--metadata))
- `priority_class_name` (String) Priority class name for the PGAdmin pod. Changing this value causes PGAdmin pod to restart. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/
- `resources` (Attributes) Resource requirements for the PGAdmin container. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--resources))
- `server_groups` (Attributes List) ServerGroups for importing PostgresClusters to pgAdmin. To create a pgAdmin with no selectors, leave this field empty. A pgAdmin created with no 'ServerGroups' will not automatically add any servers through discovery. PostgresClusters can still be added manually. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--server_groups))
- `tolerations` (Attributes List) Tolerations of the PGAdmin pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--tolerations))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--data_volume_claim_spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.data_volume_claim_spec`

Optional:

- `access_modes` (List of String) accessModes contains the desired access modes the volume should have. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1
- `data_source` (Attributes) dataSource field can be used to specify either: * An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot) * An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source, it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source. If the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, this field will always have the same contents as the DataSourceRef field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--data_volume_claim_spec--data_source))
- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any local object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified. (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--data_volume_claim_spec--data_source_ref))
- `resources` (Attributes) resources represents the minimum resources the volume should have. If RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature is enabled users are allowed to specify resource requirements that are lower than previous value but must still be higher than capacity recorded in the status field of the claim. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#resources (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--data_volume_claim_spec--resources))
- `selector` (Attributes) selector is a label query over volumes to consider for binding. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--data_volume_claim_spec--selector))
- `storage_class_name` (String) storageClassName is the name of the StorageClass required by the claim. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1
- `volume_mode` (String) volumeMode defines what type of volume is required by the claim. Value of Filesystem is implied when not included in claim spec.
- `volume_name` (String) volumeName is the binding reference to the PersistentVolume backing this claim.

The node that is most preferred is the one with the greatest sum of weights, i.e. for each node that meets all of the scheduling requirements (resource request, requiredDuringScheduling anti-affinity expressions, etc.), compute a sum by iterating through the elements of this field and adding 'weight' to the sum if the node has pods which matches the corresponding podAffinityTerm; the node(s) with the highest sum are the most preferred. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--affinity--pod_anti_affinity--preferred_during_scheduling_ignored_during_execution))
- `required_during_scheduling_ignored_during_execution` (Attributes List) If the anti-affinity requirements specified by this field are not met at scheduling time, the pod will not be scheduled onto the node. If the anti-affinity requirements specified by this field cease to be met at some point during pod execution (e.g. due to a pod label update), the system may or may not try to eventually evict the pod from its node. When there are multiple elements, the lists of nodes corresponding to each podAffinityTerm are intersected, i.e. all terms must be satisfied.
