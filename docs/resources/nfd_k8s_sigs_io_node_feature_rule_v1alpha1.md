# k8s_nfd_k8s_sigs_io_node_feature_rule_v1alpha1 (Resource)

NodeFeatureRule resource specifies a configuration for feature-based customization of node objects, such as node labeling.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "k8s_nfd_k8s_sigs_io_node_feature_rule_v1alpha1" "minimal" {
  metadata = {
    name = "test"
  }
  spec = {
    rules = []
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) NodeFeatureRuleSpec describes a NodeFeatureRule. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `rules` (Attributes List) Rules is a list of node customization rules. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--rules))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.rules`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the rule.

Optional:

- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to create if the rule matches.
- `labels_template` (String) LabelsTemplate specifies a template to expand for dynamically generating multiple labels. Data (after template expansion) must be keys with an optional value (<key>[=<value>]) separated by newlines.
- `match_any` (Attributes List) MatchAny specifies a list of matchers one of which must match. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--rules--match_any))
- `match_features` (Attributes List) MatchFeatures specifies a set of matcher terms all of which must match. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--rules--match_features))
- `vars` (Map of String) Vars is the variables to store if the rule matches. Variables do not directly inflict any changes in the node object. However, they can be referenced from other rules enabling more complex rule hierarchies, without exposing intermediary output values as labels.
- `vars_template` (String) VarsTemplate specifies a template to expand for dynamically generating multiple variables. Data (after template expansion) must be keys with an optional value (<key>[=<value>]) separated by newlines.

### Nested Schema for `spec.rules.match_any`

Required:

- `match_features` (Attributes List) MatchFeatures specifies a set of matcher terms all of which must match. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--rules--match_any--match_features))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--rules--match_any--match_features"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.rules.match_any.match_features`

Required:

- `feature` (String)
- `match_expressions` (Attributes) MatchExpressionSet contains a set of MatchExpressions, each of which is evaluated against a set of input values. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--rules--match_any--match_features--match_expressions))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--rules--match_any--match_features--match_expressions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.rules.match_any.match_features.match_expressions`

Required:

- `op` (String) Op is the operator to be applied.

Optional:

- `value` (List of String) Value is the list of values that the operand evaluates the input against. Value should be empty if the operator is Exists, DoesNotExist, IsTrue or IsFalse. Value should contain exactly one element if the operator is Gt or Lt and exactly two elements if the operator is GtLt. In other cases Value should contain at least one element.
