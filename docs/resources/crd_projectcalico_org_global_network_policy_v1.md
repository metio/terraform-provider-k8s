## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `apply_on_forward` (Boolean) ApplyOnForward indicates to apply the rules in this policy on forward traffic.
- `do_not_track` (Boolean) DoNotTrack indicates whether packets matched by the rules in this policy should go through the data plane's connection tracking, such as Linux conntrack.  If True, the rules in this policy are applied before any data plane connection tracking, and packets allowed by this policy are marked as not to be tracked.
- `egress` (Attributes List) The ordered set of egress rules.  Each rule contains a set of packet match criteria and a corresponding action to apply. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress))
- `ingress` (Attributes List) The ordered set of ingress rules.  Each rule contains a set of packet match criteria and a corresponding action to apply. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--ingress))
- `namespace_selector` (String) NamespaceSelector is an optional field for an expression used to select a pod based on namespaces.
- `order` (Number) Order is an optional field that specifies the order in which the policy is applied. Policies with higher 'order' are applied after those with lower order.  If the order is omitted, it may be considered to be 'infinite' - i.e. the policy will be applied last.  Policies with identical order will be applied in alphanumerical order based on the Policy 'Name'.
- `pre_dnat` (Boolean) PreDNAT indicates to apply the rules in this policy before any DNAT.
- `selector` (String) The selector is an expression used to pick pick out the endpoints that the policy should be applied to.  Selector expressions follow this syntax:  	label == 'string_literal'  ->  comparison, e.g. my_label == 'foo bar' 	label != 'string_literal'   ->  not equal; also matches if label is not present 	label in { 'a', 'b', 'c', ... }  ->  true if the value of label X is one of 'a', 'b', 'c' 	label not in { 'a', 'b', 'c', ... }  ->  true if the value of label X is not one of 'a', 'b', 'c' 	has(label_name)  -> True if that label is present 	! expr -> negation of expr 	expr && expr  -> Short-circuit and 	expr || expr  -> Short-circuit or 	( expr ) -> parens for grouping 	all() or the empty selector -> matches all endpoints.  Label names are allowed to contain alphanumerics, -, _ and /. String literals are more permissive but they do not support escape characters.  Examples (with made-up labels):  	type == 'webserver' && deployment == 'prod' 	type in {'frontend', 'backend'} 	deployment != 'dev' 	! has(label_name)
- `service_account_selector` (String) ServiceAccountSelector is an optional field for an expression used to select a pod based on service accounts.
- `types` (List of String) Types indicates whether this policy applies to ingress, or to egress, or to both.  When not explicitly specified (and so the value on creation is empty or nil), Calico defaults Types according to what Ingress and Egress rules are present in the policy.  The default is:  - [ PolicyTypeIngress ], if there are no Egress rules (including the case where there are   also no Ingress rules)  - [ PolicyTypeEgress ], if there are Egress rules but no Ingress rules  - [ PolicyTypeIngress, PolicyTypeEgress ], if there are both Ingress and Egress rules.  When the policy is read back again, Types will always be one of these values, never empty or nil.

### Nested Schema for `spec.egress`

Required:

- `action` (String)

Optional:

- `destination` (Attributes) Destination contains the match criteria that apply to destination entity. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--destination))
- `http` (Attributes) HTTP contains match criteria that apply to HTTP requests. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--http))
- `icmp` (Attributes) ICMP is an optional field that restricts the rule to apply to a specific type and code of ICMP traffic.  This should only be specified if the Protocol field is set to 'ICMP' or 'ICMPv6'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--icmp))
- `ip_version` (Number) IPVersion is an optional field that restricts the rule to only match a specific IP version.
- `metadata` (Attributes) Metadata contains additional information for this rule (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--metadata))
- `not_icmp` (Attributes) NotICMP is the negated version of the ICMP field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--not_icmp))
- `not_protocol` (String) NotProtocol is the negated version of the Protocol field.
- `protocol` (String) Protocol is an optional field that restricts the rule to only apply to traffic of a specific IP protocol. Required if any of the EntityRules contain Ports (because ports only apply to certain protocols).  Must be one of these string values: 'TCP', 'UDP', 'ICMP', 'ICMPv6', 'SCTP', 'UDPLite' or an integer in the range 1-255.
- `source` (Attributes) Source contains the match criteria that apply to source entity. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--source))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--egress--destination"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.egress.destination`

Optional:

- `namespace_selector` (String) NamespaceSelector is an optional field that contains a selector expression. Only traffic that originates from (or terminates at) endpoints within the selected namespaces will be matched. When both NamespaceSelector and another selector are defined on the same rule, then only workload endpoints that are matched by both selectors will be selected by the rule.  For NetworkPolicy, an empty NamespaceSelector implies that the Selector is limited to selecting only workload endpoints in the same namespace as the NetworkPolicy.  For NetworkPolicy, 'global()' NamespaceSelector implies that the Selector is limited to selecting only GlobalNetworkSet or HostEndpoint.  For GlobalNetworkPolicy, an empty NamespaceSelector implies the Selector applies to workload endpoints across all namespaces.
- `nets` (List of String) Nets is an optional field that restricts the rule to only apply to traffic that originates from (or terminates at) IP addresses in any of the given subnets.
- `not_nets` (List of String) NotNets is the negated version of the Nets field.
- `not_ports` (List of String) NotPorts is the negated version of the Ports field. Since only some protocols have ports, if any ports are specified it requires the Protocol match in the Rule to be set to 'TCP' or 'UDP'.
- `not_selector` (String) NotSelector is the negated version of the Selector field.  See Selector field for subtleties with negated selectors.
- `ports` (List of String) Ports is an optional field that restricts the rule to only apply to traffic that has a source (destination) port that matches one of these ranges/values. This value is a list of integers or strings that represent ranges of ports.  Since only some protocols have ports, if any ports are specified it requires the Protocol match in the Rule to be set to 'TCP' or 'UDP'.
- `selector` (String) Selector is an optional field that contains a selector expression (see Policy for sample syntax).  Only traffic that originates from (terminates at) endpoints matching the selector will be matched.  Note that: in addition to the negated version of the Selector (see NotSelector below), the selector expression syntax itself supports negation.  The two types of negation are subtly different. One negates the set of matched endpoints, the other negates the whole match:  	Selector = '!has(my_label)' matches packets that are from other Calico-controlled 	endpoints that do not have the label 'my_label'.  	NotSelector = 'has(my_label)' matches packets that are not from Calico-controlled 	endpoints that do have the label 'my_label'.  The effect is that the latter will accept packets from non-Calico sources whereas the former is limited to packets from Calico-controlled endpoints.
- `service_accounts` (Attributes) ServiceAccounts is an optional field that restricts the rule to only apply to traffic that originates from (or terminates at) a pod running as a matching service account. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--destination--service_accounts))
- `services` (Attributes) Services is an optional field that contains options for matching Kubernetes Services. If specified, only traffic that originates from or terminates at endpoints within the selected service(s) will be matched, and only to/from each endpoint's port.  Services cannot be specified on the same rule as Selector, NotSelector, NamespaceSelector, Nets, NotNets or ServiceAccounts.  Ports and NotPorts can only be specified with Services on ingress rules. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--destination--services))
