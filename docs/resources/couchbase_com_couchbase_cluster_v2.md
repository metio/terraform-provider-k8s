<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `image` (String) Image is the container image name that will be used to launch Couchbase server instances.  Updating this field will cause an automatic upgrade of the cluster.
- `security` (Attributes) Security defines Couchbase cluster security options such as the administrator account username and password, and user RBAC settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--security))
- `servers` (Attributes List) Servers defines server classes for the Operator to provision and manage. A server class defines what services are running and how many members make up that class.  Specifying multiple server classes allows the Operator to provision clusters with Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS).  At least one server class must be defined, and at least one server class must be running the data service. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--servers))

Optional:

- `anti_affinity` (Boolean) AntiAffinity forces the Operator to schedule different Couchbase server pods on different Kubernetes nodes.  Anti-affinity reduces the likelihood of unrecoverable failure in the event of a node issue.  Use of anti-affinity is highly recommended for production clusters.
- `auto_resource_allocation` (Attributes) AutoResourceAllocation populates pod resource requests based on the services running on that pod.  When enabled, this feature will calculate the memory request as the total of service allocations defined in 'spec.cluster', plus an overhead defined by 'spec.autoResourceAllocation.overheadPercent'.Changing individual allocations for a service will cause a cluster upgrade as allocations are modified in the underlying pods.  This field also allows default pod CPU requests and limits to be applied. All resource allocations can be overridden by explicitly configuring them in the 'spec.servers.resources' field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--auto_resource_allocation))
- `autoscale_stabilization_period` (String) AutoscaleStabilizationPeriod defines how long after a rebalance the corresponding HorizontalPodAutoscaler should remain in maintenance mode. During maintenance mode all autoscaling is disabled since every HorizontalPodAutoscaler associated with the cluster becomes inactive. Since certain metrics can be unpredictable when Couchbase is rebalancing or upgrading, setting a stabilization period helps to prevent scaling recommendations from the HorizontalPodAutoscaler for a provided period of time.  Values must be a valid Kubernetes duration of 0s or higher: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration A value of 0, puts the cluster in maintenance mode during rebalance but immediately exits this mode once the rebalance has completed. When undefined, the HPA is never put into maintenance mode during rebalance.
- `backup` (Attributes) Backup defines whether the Operator should manage automated backups, and how to lookup backup resources. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--backup))
- `buckets` (Attributes) Buckets defines whether the Operator should manage buckets, and how to lookup bucket resources. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--buckets))
- `cluster` (Attributes) ClusterSettings define Couchbase cluster-wide settings such as memory allocation, failover characteristics and index settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--cluster))
- `enable_online_volume_expansion` (Boolean) EnableOnlineVolumeExpansion enables online expansion of Persistent Volumes. You can only expand a PVC if its storage class's 'allowVolumeExpansion' field is set to true. Additionally, Kubernetes feature 'ExpandInUsePersistentVolumes' must be enabled in order to expand the volumes which are actively bound to Pods. Volumes can only be expanded and not reduced to a smaller size. See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#resizing-an-in-use-persistentvolumeclaim  If 'EnableOnlineVolumeExpansion' is enabled for use within an environment that does not actually support online volume and file system expansion then the cluster will fallback to rolling upgrade procedure to create a new set of Pods for use with resized Volumes. More info:  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#expanding-persistent-volumes-claims
- `enable_preview_scaling` (Boolean) DEPRECATED - This option only exists for backwards compatibility and no longer restricts autoscaling to ephemeral services. EnablePreviewScaling enables autoscaling for stateful services and buckets.
- `hibernate` (Boolean) Hibernate is whether to hibernate the cluster.
- `hibernation_strategy` (String) HibernationStrategy defines how to hibernate the cluster.  When Immediate the Operator will immediately delete all pods and take no further action until the hibernate field is set to false.
- `logging` (Attributes) Logging defines Operator logging options. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--logging))
- `monitoring` (Attributes) Monitoring defines any Operator managed integration into 3rd party monitoring infrastructure. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--monitoring))
- `networking` (Attributes) Networking defines Couchbase cluster networking options such as network topology, TLS and DDNS settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking))
- `paused` (Boolean) Paused is to pause the control of the operator for the Couchbase cluster. This does not pause the cluster itself, instead stopping the operator from taking any action.
- `platform` (String) Platform gives a hint as to what platform we are running on and how to configure services.  This field must be one of 'aws', 'gke' or 'azure'.
- `recovery_policy` (String) RecoveryPolicy controls how aggressive the Operator is when recovering cluster topology.  When PrioritizeDataIntegrity, the Operator will delegate failover exclusively to Couchbase server, relying on it to only allow recovery when safe to do so.  When PrioritizeUptime, the Operator will wait for a period after the expected auto-failover of the cluster, before forcefully failing-over the pods. This may cause data loss, and is only expected to be used on clusters with ephemeral data, where the loss of the pod means that the data is known to be unrecoverable. This field must be either 'PrioritizeDataIntegrity' or 'PrioritizeUptime', defaulting to 'PrioritizeDataIntegrity'.
- `rolling_upgrade` (Attributes) When 'spec.upgradeStrategy' is set to 'RollingUpgrade' it will, by default, upgrade one pod at a time.  If this field is specified then that number can be increased. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--rolling_upgrade))
- `security_context` (Attributes) SecurityContext allows the configuration of the security context for all Couchbase server pods.  When using persistent volumes you may need to set the fsGroup field in order to write to the volume.  For non-root clusters you must also set runAsUser to 1000, corresponding to the Couchbase user in official container images.  More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/ (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--security_context))
- `server_groups` (List of String) ServerGroups define the set of availability zones you want to distribute pods over, and construct Couchbase server groups for.  By default, most cloud providers will label nodes with the key 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', the values associated with that key are used here to provide explicit scheduling by the Operator.  You may manually label nodes using the 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone' key, to provide failure-domain aware scheduling when none is provided for you.  Global server groups are applied to all server classes, and may be overridden on a per-server class basis to give more control over scheduling and server groups.
- `software_update_notifications` (Boolean) SoftwareUpdateNotifications enables software update notifications in the UI. When enabled, the UI will alert when a Couchbase server upgrade is available.
- `upgrade_strategy` (String) UpgradeStrategy controls how aggressive the Operator is when performing a cluster upgrade.  When a rolling upgrade is requested, pods are upgraded one at a time.  This strategy is slower, however less disruptive.  When an immediate upgrade strategy is requested, all pods are upgraded at the same time.  This strategy is faster, but more disruptive.  This field must be either 'RollingUpgrade' or 'ImmediateUpgrade', defaulting to 'RollingUpgrade'.
- `volume_claim_templates` (Attributes List) VolumeClaimTemplates define the desired characteristics of a volume that can be requested/claimed by a pod, for example the storage class to use and the volume size.  Volume claim templates are referred to by name by server class volume mount configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volume_claim_templates))
- `xdcr` (Attributes) XDCR defines whether the Operator should manage XDCR, remote clusters and how to lookup replication resources. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--xdcr))

The higher the value, the higher the priority.
- `priority_class_name` (String) If specified, indicates the pod's priority. 'system-node-critical' and 'system-cluster-critical' are two special keywords which indicate the highest priorities with the former being the highest priority. Any other name must be defined by creating a PriorityClass object with that name. If not specified, the pod priority will be default or zero if there is no default.
- `runtime_class_name` (String) RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io group, which should be used to run this pod.  If no RuntimeClass resource matches the named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, the 'legacy' RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an empty definition that uses the default runtime handler. More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/585-runtime-class This is a beta feature as of Kubernetes v1.14.
- `scheduler_name` (String) If specified, the pod will be dispatched by specified scheduler. If not specified, the pod will be dispatched by default scheduler.
- `service_account` (String) DeprecatedServiceAccount is a depreciated alias for ServiceAccountName. Deprecated: Use serviceAccountName instead.
- `service_account_name` (String) ServiceAccountName is the name of the ServiceAccount to use to run this pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/
- `set_hostname_as_fqdn` (Boolean) If true the pod's hostname will be configured as the pod's FQDN, rather than the leaf name (the default). In Linux containers, this means setting the FQDN in the hostname field of the kernel (the nodename field of struct utsname). In Windows containers, this means setting the registry value of hostname for the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesTcpipParameters to FQDN. If a pod does not have FQDN, this has no effect. Default to false.
- `share_process_namespace` (Boolean) Share a single process namespace between all of the containers in a pod. When this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes from other containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both be set. Optional: Default to false.
- `termination_grace_period_seconds` (Number) Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully. May be decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). If this value is nil, the default grace period will be used instead. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. Defaults to 30 seconds.
- `tolerations` (Attributes List) If specified, the pod's tolerations. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--servers--pod--spec--tolerations))
- `topology_spread_constraints` (Attributes List) TopologySpreadConstraints describes how a group of pods ought to spread across topology domains. Scheduler will schedule pods in a way which abides by the constraints. All topologySpreadConstraints are ANDed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--servers--pod--spec--topology_spread_constraints))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--servers--pod--spec--os"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.servers.pod.spec.os`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name is the name of the operating system. The currently supported values are linux and windows. Additional value may be defined in future and can be one of: https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/config.md#platform-specific-configuration Clients should expect to handle additional values and treat unrecognized values in this field as os: null


<a id="nestedatt--spec--servers--pod--spec--tolerations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.servers.pod.spec.tolerations`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
- `value` (String) Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--servers--pod--spec--topology_spread_constraints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.servers.pod.spec.topology_spread_constraints`

Required:

- `max_skew` (Number) MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule', it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 1/1/0: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |   P   |   P   |       | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 1/1/1; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(2-0) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway', it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
- `topology_key` (String) TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a 'bucket', and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. It's a required field.
- `when_unsatisfiable` (String) WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location, but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the skew. A constraint is considered 'Unsatisfiable' for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate 'MaxSkew' on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

Optional:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--servers--pod--spec--topology_spread_constraints--label_selector))

- `match_expressions` (Attributes List) matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--servers--pod--spec--topology_spread_constraints--label_selector--match_expressions))
- `match_labels` (Map of String) matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--servers--pod--spec--topology_spread_constraints--label_selector--match_expressions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.servers.pod.spec.topology_spread_constraints.label_selector.match_labels`

Required:

- `key` (String) key is the label key that the selector applies to.
- `operator` (String) operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

Optional:

- `values` (List of String) values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.

### Nested Schema for `spec.servers.volume_mounts`

Optional:

- `analytics` (List of String) AnalyticsClaims are persistent volumes that encompass analytics storage associated with the analytics service.  Analytics claims can only be used on server classes running the analytics service, and must be used in conjunction with the default claim. This field allows the analytics service to use different storage media (e.g. SSD), and scale horizontally, to improve performance of this service.  This field references a volume claim template name as defined in 'spec.volumeClaimTemplates'.
- `data` (String) DataClaim is a persistent volume that encompasses key/value storage associated with the data service.  The data claim can only be used on server classes running the data service, and must be used in conjunction with the default claim.  This field allows the data service to use different storage media (e.g. SSD) to improve performance of this service.  This field references a volume claim template name as defined in 'spec.volumeClaimTemplates'.
- `default` (String) DefaultClaim is a persistent volume that encompasses all Couchbase persistent data, including document storage, indexes and logs.  The default volume can be used with any server class.  Use of the default claim allows the Operator to recover failed pods from the persistent volume far quicker than if the pod were using ephemeral storage.  The default claim cannot be used at the same time as the logs claim within the same server class.  This field references a volume claim template name as defined in 'spec.volumeClaimTemplates'.
- `index` (String) IndexClaim s a persistent volume that encompasses index storage associated with the index and search services.  The index claim can only be used on server classes running the index or search services, and must be used in conjunction with the default claim.  This field allows the index and/or search service to use different storage media (e.g. SSD) to improve performance of this service. This field references a volume claim template name as defined in 'spec.volumeClaimTemplates'. Whilst this references index primarily, note that the full text search (FTS) service also uses this same mount.
- `logs` (String) LogsClaim is a persistent volume that encompasses only Couchbase server logs to aid with supporting the product.  The logs claim can only be used on server classes running the following services: query, search & eventing.  The logs claim cannot be used at the same time as the default claim within the same server class.  This field references a volume claim template name as defined in 'spec.volumeClaimTemplates'. Whilst the logs claim can be used with the search service, the recommendation is to use the default claim for these. The reason for this is that a failure of these nodes will require indexes to be rebuilt and subsequent performance impact.



<a id="nestedatt--spec--auto_resource_allocation"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.auto_resource_allocation`

Optional:

- `cpu_limits` (Dynamic) CPULimits automatically populates the CPU limits across all Couchbase server pods.  This field defaults to '4' CPUs.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes
- `cpu_requests` (Dynamic) CPURequests automatically populates the CPU requests across all Couchbase server pods.  The default value of '2', is the minimum recommended number of CPUs required to run Couchbase Server.  Explicitly specifying the CPU request for a particular server class will override this value.

- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--buckets"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.buckets`

Optional:

- `managed` (Boolean) Managed defines whether buckets are managed by the Operator (true), or user managed (false). When Operator managed, all buckets must be defined with either CouchbaseBucket, CouchbaseEphemeralBucket or CouchbaseMemcachedBucket resources.  Manual addition of buckets will be reverted by the Operator.  When user managed, the Operator will not interrogate buckets at all.  This field defaults to false.
- `selector` (Attributes) Selector is a label selector used to list buckets in the namespace that are managed by the Operator. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--buckets--selector))
- `synchronize` (Boolean) Synchronize allows unmanaged buckets, scopes, and collections to be synchronized as Kubernetes resources by the Operator.  This feature is intended for development only and should not be used for production workloads.  The synchronization workflow starts with 'spec.buckets.managed' being set to false, the user can manually create buckets, scopes, and collections using the Couchbase UI, or other tooling.  When you wish to commit to Kubernetes resources, you must specify a unique label selector in the 'spec.buckets.selector' field, and this field is set to true.  The Operator will create Kubernetes resources for you, and upon completion set the cluster's 'Synchronized' status condition.  You may then safely set 'spec.buckets.managed' to true and the Operator will manage these resources as per usual.  To update an already managed data topology, you must first set it to unmanaged, make any changes, and delete any old resources, then follow the standard synchronization workflow.  The Operator can not, and will not, ever delete, or make modifications to resource specifications that are intended to be user managed, or managed by a life cycle management tool. These actions must be instigated by an end user.  For a more complete experience, refer to the documentation for the 'cao save' and 'cao restore' CLI commands.

- `enabled` (Boolean) Enabled is a boolean that enables the audit capabilities.
- `garbage_collection` (Attributes) Handle all optional garbage collection (GC) configuration for the audit functionality. This is not part of the audit REST API, it is intended to handle GC automatically for the audit logs. By default the Couchbase Server rotates the audit logs but does not clean up the rotated logs. This is left as an operation for the cluster administrator to manage, the operator allows for us to automate this: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/manage/manage-security/manage-auditing.html (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--logging--audit--garbage_collection))

Optional:

- `configuration_name` (String) ConfigurationName is the name of the Secret to use holding the logging configuration in the namespace. A Secret is used to ensure we can safely store credentials but this can be populated from plaintext if acceptable too. If it does not exist then one will be created with defaults in the namespace so it can be easily updated whilst running. Note that if running multiple clusters in the same kubernetes namespace then you should use a separate Secret for each, otherwise the first cluster will take ownership (if created) and the Secret will be cleaned up when that cluster is removed. If running clusters in separate namespaces then they will be separate Secrets anyway.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Enabled is a boolean that enables the logging sidecar container.
- `manage_configuration` (Boolean) A boolean which indicates whether the operator should manage the configuration or not. If omitted then this defaults to true which means the operator will attempt to reconcile it to default values. To use a custom configuration make sure to set this to false. Note that the ownership of any Secret is not changed so if a Secret is created externally it can be updated by the operator but it's ownership stays the same so it will be cleaned up when it's owner is.
- `sidecar` (Attributes) Any specific logging sidecar container configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--logging--server--sidecar))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--logging--server--sidecar"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.logging.server.sidecar`

<a id="nestedatt--spec--networking"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.networking`

Optional:

- `address_family` (String) AddressFamily allows the manual selection of the address family to use. When this field is not set, Couchbase server will default to using IPv4 for internal communication and also support IPv6 on dual stack systems. Setting this field to either IPv4 or IPv6 will force Couchbase to use the selected protocol for internal communication, and also disable all other protocols to provide added security and simplicty when defining firewall rules.  Disabling of address families is only supported in Couchbase Server 7.0.2+.
- `admin_console_service_template` (Attributes) AdminConsoleServiceTemplate provides a template used by the Operator to create and manage the admin console service.  This allows services to be annotated, the service type defined and any other options that Kubernetes provides.  When using a LoadBalancer service type, TLS and dynamic DNS must also be enabled. The Operator reserves the right to modify or replace any field.  More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.21/#service-v1-core (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking--admin_console_service_template))
- `admin_console_service_type` (String) DEPRECATED - by adminConsoleServiceTemplate. AdminConsoleServiceType defines whether to create a node port or load balancer service.

- `admin_console_services` (List of String) DEPRECATED - not required by Couchbase Server 6.5.0 onward. AdminConsoleServices is a selector to choose specific services to expose via the admin console. This field may contain any of 'data', 'index', 'query', 'search', 'eventing' and 'analytics'.  Each service may only be included once.
- `disable_ui_over_http` (Boolean) DisableUIOverHTTP is used to explicitly enable and disable UI access over the HTTP protocol.  If not specified, this field defaults to false.
- `disable_ui_over_https` (Boolean) DisableUIOverHTTPS is used to explicitly enable and disable UI access over the HTTPS protocol.  If not specified, this field defaults to false.
- `dns` (Attributes) DNS defines information required for Dynamic DNS support. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking--dns))
- `expose_admin_console` (Boolean) ExposeAdminConsole creates a service referencing the admin console. The service is configured by the adminConsoleServiceTemplate field.
- `exposed_feature_service_template` (Attributes) ExposedFeatureServiceTemplate provides a template used by the Operator to create and manage per-pod services.  This allows services to be annotated, the service type defined and any other options that Kubernetes provides.  When using a LoadBalancer service type, TLS and dynamic DNS must also be enabled. The Operator reserves the right to modify or replace any field.  More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.21/#service-v1-core (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking--exposed_feature_service_template))
- `exposed_feature_service_type` (String) DEPRECATED - by exposedFeatureServiceTemplate. ExposedFeatureServiceType defines whether to create a node port or load balancer service. When using a LoadBalancer service type, TLS and dynamic DNS must also be enabled. This field must be one of 'NodePort' or 'LoadBalancer', defaulting to 'NodePort'.
- `exposed_feature_traffic_policy` (String) DEPRECATED  - by exposedFeatureServiceTemplate. ExposedFeatureTrafficPolicy defines how packets should be routed from a load balancer service to a Couchbase pod.  When local, traffic is routed directly to the pod.  When cluster, traffic is routed to any node, then forwarded on.  While cluster routing may be slower, there are some situations where it is required for connectivity.  This field must be either 'Cluster' or 'Local', defaulting to 'Local',
- `exposed_features` (List of String) ExposedFeatures is a list of Couchbase features to expose when using a networking model that exposes the Couchbase cluster externally to Kubernetes.  This field also triggers the creation of per-pod services used by clients to connect to the Couchbase cluster.  When admin, only the administrator port is exposed, allowing remote administration.  When xdcr, only the services required for remote replication are exposed. The xdcr feature is only required when the cluster is the destination of an XDCR replication.  When client, all services are exposed as required for client SDK operation. This field may contain any of 'admin', 'xdcr' and 'client'.  Each feature may only be included once.
- `load_balancer_source_ranges` (List of String) DEPRECATED - by adminConsoleServiceTemplate and exposedFeatureServiceTemplate. LoadBalancerSourceRanges applies only when an exposed service is of type LoadBalancer and limits the source IP ranges that are allowed to use the service.

- `tls` (Attributes) TLS defines the TLS configuration for the cluster including server and client certificate configuration, and TLS security policies. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking--tls))
- `wait_for_address_reachable` (String) WaitForAddressReachable is used to set the timeout between when polling of external addresses is started, and when it is deemed a failure.  Polling of DNS name availability inherently dangerous due to negative caching, so prefer the use of an initial 'waitForAddressReachableDelay' to allow propagation.
- `wait_for_address_reachable_delay` (String) WaitForAddressReachableDelay is used to defer operator checks that ensure external addresses are reachable before new nodes are balanced in to the cluster.  This prevents negative DNS caching while waiting for external-DDNS controllers to propagate addresses.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--networking--admin_console_service_template"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.networking.admin_console_service_template`

Optional:

- `metadata` (Attributes) Standard objects metadata.  This is a curated version for use with Couchbase resource templates. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking--admin_console_service_template--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) ServiceSpec describes the attributes that a user creates on a service. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking--admin_console_service_template--spec))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--networking--admin_console_service_template--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.networking.admin_console_service_template.spec`

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--networking--admin_console_service_template--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.networking.admin_console_service_template.spec`

Optional:

- `allocate_load_balancer_node_ports` (Boolean) allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts defines if NodePorts will be automatically allocated for services with type LoadBalancer.  Default is 'true'. It may be set to 'false' if the cluster load-balancer does not rely on NodePorts.  If the caller requests specific NodePorts (by specifying a value), those requests will be respected, regardless of this field. This field may only be set for services with type LoadBalancer and will be cleared if the type is changed to any other type. This field is beta-level and is only honored by servers that enable the ServiceLBNodePortControl feature.
- `cluster_i_ps` (List of String) ClusterIPs is a list of IP addresses assigned to this service, and are usually assigned randomly.  If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as per system configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to the service; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field may not be changed through updates unless the type field is also being changed to ExternalName (which requires this field to be empty) or the type field is being changed from ExternalName (in which case this field may optionally be specified, as describe above).  Valid values are 'None', empty string (''), or a valid IP address.  Setting this to 'None' makes a 'headless service' (no virtual IP), which is useful when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying is not required.  Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specified when creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.  If this field is not specified, it will be initialized from the clusterIP field.  If this field is specified, clients must ensure that clusterIPs[0] and clusterIP have the same value.  This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack IPs, in either order). These IPs must correspond to the values of the ipFamilies field. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `cluster_ip` (String) clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assigned randomly. If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as per system configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to the service; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field may not be changed through updates unless the type field is also being changed to ExternalName (which requires this field to be blank) or the type field is being changed from ExternalName (in which case this field may optionally be specified, as describe above).  Valid values are 'None', empty string (''), or a valid IP address. Setting this to 'None' makes a 'headless service' (no virtual IP), which is useful when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying is not required.  Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specified when creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `external_i_ps` (List of String) externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will also accept traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed by Kubernetes.  The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP.  A common example is external load-balancers that are not part of the Kubernetes system.
- `external_name` (String) externalName is the external reference that discovery mechanisms will return as an alias for this service (e.g. a DNS CNAME record). No proxying will be involved.  Must be a lowercase RFC-1123 hostname (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires 'type' to be 'ExternalName'.
- `external_traffic_policy` (String) externalTrafficPolicy denotes if this Service desires to route external traffic to node-local or cluster-wide endpoints. 'Local' preserves the client source IP and avoids a second hop for LoadBalancer and Nodeport type services, but risks potentially imbalanced traffic spreading. 'Cluster' obscures the client source IP and may cause a second hop to another node, but should have good overall load-spreading.
- `health_check_node_port` (Number) healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service. This only applies when type is set to LoadBalancer and externalTrafficPolicy is set to Local. If a value is specified, is in-range, and is not in use, it will be used.  If not specified, a value will be automatically allocated.  External systems (e.g. load-balancers) can use this port to determine if a given node holds endpoints for this service or not.  If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type).
- `internal_traffic_policy` (String) InternalTrafficPolicy specifies if the cluster internal traffic should be routed to all endpoints or node-local endpoints only. 'Cluster' routes internal traffic to a Service to all endpoints. 'Local' routes traffic to node-local endpoints only, traffic is dropped if no node-local endpoints are ready. The default value is 'Cluster'.
- `ip_families` (List of String) IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to this service. This field is usually assigned automatically based on cluster configuration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If this field is specified manually, the requested family is available in the cluster, and ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field is conditionally mutable: it allows for adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not allow changing the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are 'IPv4' and 'IPv6'.  This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to 'headless' services. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.  This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, in either order).  These families must correspond to the values of the clusterIPs field, if specified. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.
- `ip_family_policy` (String) IPFamilyPolicy represents the dual-stack-ness requested or required by this Service. If there is no value provided, then this field will be set to SingleStack. Services can be 'SingleStack' (a single IP family), 'PreferDualStack' (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters or a single IP family on single-stack clusters), or 'RequireDualStack' (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters, otherwise fail). The ipFamilies and clusterIPs fields depend on the value of this field. This field will be wiped when updating a service to type ExternalName.
- `load_balancer_class` (String) loadBalancerClass is the class of the load balancer implementation this Service belongs to. If specified, the value of this field must be a label-style identifier, with an optional prefix, e.g. 'internal-vip' or 'example.com/internal-vip'. Unprefixed names are reserved for end-users. This field can only be set when the Service type is 'LoadBalancer'. If not set, the default load balancer implementation is used, today this is typically done through the cloud provider integration, but should apply for any default implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancer implementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancer implementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field. This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type 'LoadBalancer'. Once set, it can not be changed. This field will be wiped when a service is updated to a non 'LoadBalancer' type.
- `load_balancer_ip` (String) Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer LoadBalancer will get created with the IP specified in this field. This feature depends on whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifying the loadBalancerIP when a load balancer is created. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.
- `load_balancer_source_ranges` (List of String) If specified and supported by the platform, this will restrict traffic through the cloud-provider load-balancer will be restricted to the specified client IPs. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.' More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/
- `session_affinity` (String) Supports 'ClientIP' and 'None'. Used to maintain session affinity. Enable client IP based session affinity. Must be ClientIP or None. Defaults to None. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `session_affinity_config` (Attributes) sessionAffinityConfig contains the configurations of session affinity. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking--admin_console_service_template--spec--session_affinity_config))
- `type` (String) type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. 'ClusterIP' allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is 'None', no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather than a virtual IP. 'NodePort' builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. 'LoadBalancer' builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. 'ExternalName' aliases this service to the specified externalName. Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--networking--exposed_feature_service_template--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.networking.exposed_feature_service_template.spec`

Optional:

- `allocate_load_balancer_node_ports` (Boolean) allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts defines if NodePorts will be automatically allocated for services with type LoadBalancer.  Default is 'true'. It may be set to 'false' if the cluster load-balancer does not rely on NodePorts.  If the caller requests specific NodePorts (by specifying a value), those requests will be respected, regardless of this field. This field may only be set for services with type LoadBalancer and will be cleared if the type is changed to any other type. This field is beta-level and is only honored by servers that enable the ServiceLBNodePortControl feature.
- `cluster_i_ps` (List of String) ClusterIPs is a list of IP addresses assigned to this service, and are usually assigned randomly.  If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as per system configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to the service; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field may not be changed through updates unless the type field is also being changed to ExternalName (which requires this field to be empty) or the type field is being changed from ExternalName (in which case this field may optionally be specified, as describe above).  Valid values are 'None', empty string (''), or a valid IP address.  Setting this to 'None' makes a 'headless service' (no virtual IP), which is useful when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying is not required.  Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specified when creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.  If this field is not specified, it will be initialized from the clusterIP field.  If this field is specified, clients must ensure that clusterIPs[0] and clusterIP have the same value.  This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack IPs, in either order). These IPs must correspond to the values of the ipFamilies field. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `cluster_ip` (String) clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assigned randomly. If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as per system configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to the service; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field may not be changed through updates unless the type field is also being changed to ExternalName (which requires this field to be blank) or the type field is being changed from ExternalName (in which case this field may optionally be specified, as describe above).  Valid values are 'None', empty string (''), or a valid IP address. Setting this to 'None' makes a 'headless service' (no virtual IP), which is useful when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying is not required.  Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specified when creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `external_i_ps` (List of String) externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will also accept traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed by Kubernetes.  The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP.  A common example is external load-balancers that are not part of the Kubernetes system.
- `external_name` (String) externalName is the external reference that discovery mechanisms will return as an alias for this service (e.g. a DNS CNAME record). No proxying will be involved.  Must be a lowercase RFC-1123 hostname (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires 'type' to be 'ExternalName'.
- `external_traffic_policy` (String) externalTrafficPolicy denotes if this Service desires to route external traffic to node-local or cluster-wide endpoints. 'Local' preserves the client source IP and avoids a second hop for LoadBalancer and Nodeport type services, but risks potentially imbalanced traffic spreading. 'Cluster' obscures the client source IP and may cause a second hop to another node, but should have good overall load-spreading.
- `health_check_node_port` (Number) healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service. This only applies when type is set to LoadBalancer and externalTrafficPolicy is set to Local. If a value is specified, is in-range, and is not in use, it will be used.  If not specified, a value will be automatically allocated.  External systems (e.g. load-balancers) can use this port to determine if a given node holds endpoints for this service or not.  If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type).
- `internal_traffic_policy` (String) InternalTrafficPolicy specifies if the cluster internal traffic should be routed to all endpoints or node-local endpoints only. 'Cluster' routes internal traffic to a Service to all endpoints. 'Local' routes traffic to node-local endpoints only, traffic is dropped if no node-local endpoints are ready. The default value is 'Cluster'.
- `ip_families` (List of String) IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to this service. This field is usually assigned automatically based on cluster configuration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If this field is specified manually, the requested family is available in the cluster, and ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field is conditionally mutable: it allows for adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not allow changing the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are 'IPv4' and 'IPv6'.  This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to 'headless' services. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.  This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, in either order).  These families must correspond to the values of the clusterIPs field, if specified. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.
- `ip_family_policy` (String) IPFamilyPolicy represents the dual-stack-ness requested or required by this Service. If there is no value provided, then this field will be set to SingleStack. Services can be 'SingleStack' (a single IP family), 'PreferDualStack' (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters or a single IP family on single-stack clusters), or 'RequireDualStack' (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters, otherwise fail). The ipFamilies and clusterIPs fields depend on the value of this field. This field will be wiped when updating a service to type ExternalName.
- `load_balancer_class` (String) loadBalancerClass is the class of the load balancer implementation this Service belongs to. If specified, the value of this field must be a label-style identifier, with an optional prefix, e.g. 'internal-vip' or 'example.com/internal-vip'. Unprefixed names are reserved for end-users. This field can only be set when the Service type is 'LoadBalancer'. If not set, the default load balancer implementation is used, today this is typically done through the cloud provider integration, but should apply for any default implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancer implementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancer implementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field. This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type 'LoadBalancer'. Once set, it can not be changed. This field will be wiped when a service is updated to a non 'LoadBalancer' type.
- `load_balancer_ip` (String) Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer LoadBalancer will get created with the IP specified in this field. This feature depends on whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifying the loadBalancerIP when a load balancer is created. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.
- `load_balancer_source_ranges` (List of String) If specified and supported by the platform, this will restrict traffic through the cloud-provider load-balancer will be restricted to the specified client IPs. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.' More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/
- `session_affinity` (String) Supports 'ClientIP' and 'None'. Used to maintain session affinity. Enable client IP based session affinity. Must be ClientIP or None. Defaults to None. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
- `session_affinity_config` (Attributes) sessionAffinityConfig contains the configurations of session affinity. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking--exposed_feature_service_template--spec--session_affinity_config))
- `type` (String) type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. 'ClusterIP' allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is 'None', no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather than a virtual IP. 'NodePort' builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. 'LoadBalancer' builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. 'ExternalName' aliases this service to the specified externalName. Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types

- `node_to_node_encryption` (String) NodeToNodeEncryption specifies whether to encrypt data between Couchbase nodes within the same cluster.  This may come at the expense of performance.  When control plane only encryption is used, only cluster management traffic is encrypted between nodes.  When all, all traffic is encrypted, including database documents. When strict mode is used, it is the same as all, but also disables all plaintext ports.  Strict mode is only available on Couchbase Server versions 7.1 and greater. Node to node encryption can only be used when TLS certificates are managed by the Operator.  This field must be either 'ControlPlaneOnly', 'All', or 'Strict'.
- `root_c_as` (List of String) RootCAs defines a set of secrets that reside in this namespace that contain additional CA certificates that should be installed in Couchbase.  The CA certificates that are defined here are in addition to those defined for the cluster, optionally by couchbaseclusters.spec.networking.tls.secretSource, and thus should not be duplicated.  Secrets referred to must be of well-know type 'kubernetes.io/tls' and must contain the CA certificate under the key 'tls.crt'. Multiple root CA certificates are only supported on Couchbase Server 7.1 and greater, and not with legacy couchbaseclusters.spec.networking.tls.static configuration.
- `secret_source` (Attributes) SecretSource enables the user to specify a secret conforming to the Kubernetes TLS secret specification that is used for the Couchbase server certificate, and optionally the Operator's client certificate, providing cert-manager compatibility without having to specify a separate root CA.

(see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking--tls--secret_source))
- `static` (Attributes) DEPRECATED - by couchbaseclusters.spec.networking.tls.secretSource. Static enables user to generate static x509 certificates and keys, put them into Kubernetes secrets, and specify them here.  Static secrets are Couchbase specific, and follow no well-known standards. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking--tls--static))
- `tls_minimum_version` (String) TLSMinimumVersion specifies the minimum TLS version the Couchbase server can negotiate with a client.  Must be one of TLS1.0, TLS1.1 TLS1.2 or TLS1.3, defaulting to TLS1.2.  TLS1.3 is only valid for Couchbase Server 7.1.0 onward.

Optional:

- `client_secret_name` (String) ClientSecretName specifies the secret name, in the same namespace as the cluster, the contains client TLS data.  The secret is expected to contain 'tls.crt' and 'tls.key' as per the Kubernetes.io/tls secret type.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--networking--tls--static"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.networking.tls.tls_minimum_version`

Optional:

- `operator_secret` (String) OperatorSecret is a secret name containing TLS certs used by operator to talk securely to this cluster.  The secret must contain a CA certificate (data key ca.crt).  If client authentication is enabled, then the secret must also contain a client certificate chain (data key 'couchbase-operator.crt') and private key (data key 'couchbase-operator.key').
- `server_secret` (String) ServerSecret is a secret name containing TLS certs used by each Couchbase member pod for the communication between Couchbase server and its clients.  The secret must contain a certificate chain (data key 'couchbase-operator.crt') and a private key (data key 'couchbase-operator.key').  The private key must be in the PKCS#1 RSA format.

- `max_upgradable_percent` (String) MaxUpgradablePercent allows the number of pods affected by an upgrade at any one time to be increased.  By default a rolling upgrade will upgrade one pod at a time.  This field allows that limit to be removed. This field must be an integer percentage, e.g. '10%', in the range 1% to 100%. Percentages are relative to the total cluster size, and rounded down to the nearest whole number, with a minimum of 1.  For example, a 10 pod cluster, and 25% allowed to upgrade, would yield 2.5 pods per iteration, rounded down to 2. The smallest of 'maxUpgradable' and 'maxUpgradablePercent' takes precedence if both are defined.

- `run_as_group` (Number) The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime default if unset. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for that container. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
- `run_as_non_root` (Boolean) Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such validation will be performed. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.
- `run_as_user` (Number) The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for that container. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.

- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) Specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any local object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified. (Alpha) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volume_claim_templates--spec--data_source_ref))
- `resources` (Attributes) Resources represents the minimum resources the volume should have.

- `authentication_secret` (String) AuthenticationSecret is a secret used to authenticate when establishing a remote connection.  It is only required when not using mTLS.  The secret must contain a username (secret key 'username') and password (secret key 'password').
- `replications` (Attributes) Replications are replication streams from this cluster to the remote one. This field defines how to look up CouchbaseReplication resources.  By default any CouchbaseReplication resources in the namespace will be considered. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--xdcr--remote_clusters--replications))
- `tls` (Attributes) TLS if specified references a resource containing the necessary certificate data for an encrypted connection. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--xdcr--remote_clusters--tls))

### Nested Schema for `spec.xdcr.remote_clusters.tls`

Optional:

- `selector` (Attributes) Selector allows CouchbaseReplication resources to be filtered based on labels. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--xdcr--remote_clusters--tls--selector))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--xdcr--remote_clusters--tls--selector"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.xdcr.remote_clusters.tls.selector`

Optional:

- `match_expressions` (Attributes List) matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--xdcr--remote_clusters--tls--selector--match_expressions))
- `match_labels` (Map of String) matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.

### Nested Schema for `spec.xdcr.remote_clusters.tls.selector.match_labels`

Required:

- `key` (String) key is the label key that the selector applies to.
- `operator` (String) operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

Optional:

- `values` (List of String) values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.




<a id="nestedatt--spec--xdcr--remote_clusters--tls"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.xdcr.remote_clusters.tls`

Required:

- `secret` (String) Secret references a secret containing the CA certificate (data key 'ca'), and optionally a client certificate (data key 'certificate') and key (data key 'key').
