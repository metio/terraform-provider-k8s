## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) OCIRepositorySpec defines the desired state of OCIRepository (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `interval` (String) The interval at which to check for image updates.
- `url` (String) URL is a reference to an OCI artifact repository hosted on a remote container registry.

Optional:

- `cert_secret_ref` (Attributes) CertSecretRef can be given the name of a secret containing either or both of  - a PEM-encoded client certificate ('certFile') and private key ('keyFile'); - a PEM-encoded CA certificate ('caFile')  and whichever are supplied, will be used for connecting to the registry. The client cert and key are useful if you are authenticating with a certificate; the CA cert is useful if you are using a self-signed server certificate. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--cert_secret_ref))
- `ignore` (String) Ignore overrides the set of excluded patterns in the .sourceignore format (which is the same as .gitignore). If not provided, a default will be used, consult the documentation for your version to find out what those are.
- `insecure` (Boolean) Insecure allows connecting to a non-TLS HTTP container registry.
- `layer_selector` (Attributes) LayerSelector specifies which layer should be extracted from the OCI artifact. When not specified, the first layer found in the artifact is selected. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--layer_selector))
- `provider` (String) The provider used for authentication, can be 'aws', 'azure', 'gcp' or 'generic'. When not specified, defaults to 'generic'.
- `ref` (Attributes) The OCI reference to pull and monitor for changes, defaults to the latest tag. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--ref))
- `secret_ref` (Attributes) SecretRef contains the secret name containing the registry login credentials to resolve image metadata. The secret must be of type kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--secret_ref))
- `service_account_name` (String) ServiceAccountName is the name of the Kubernetes ServiceAccount used to authenticate the image pull if the service account has attached pull secrets. For more information: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#add-imagepullsecrets-to-a-service-account
- `suspend` (Boolean) This flag tells the controller to suspend the reconciliation of this source.
- `timeout` (String) The timeout for remote OCI Repository operations like pulling, defaults to 60s.
- `verify` (Attributes) Verify contains the secret name containing the trusted public keys used to verify the signature and specifies which provider to use to check whether OCI image is authentic. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--verify))

### Nested Schema for `spec.cert_secret_ref`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the referent.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--layer_selector"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.layer_selector`

Optional:

- `media_type` (String) MediaType specifies the OCI media type of the layer which should be extracted from the OCI Artifact. The first layer matching this type is selected.
- `operation` (String) Operation specifies how the selected layer should be processed. By default, the layer compressed content is extracted to storage. When the operation is set to 'copy', the layer compressed content is persisted to storage as it is.

### Nested Schema for `spec.ref`

Optional:
