  CiliumIdentity is a CRD that represents an identity managed by Cilium. It is intended as a backing store for identity allocation, acting as the global coordination backend, and can be used in place of a KVStore (such as etcd). The name of the CRD is the numeric identity and the labels on the CRD object are the the kubernetes sourced labels seen by cilium. This is currently the only label source possible when running under kubernetes. Non-kubernetes labels are filtered but all labels, from all sources, are places in the SecurityLabels field. These also include the source and are used to define the identity. The labels under metav1.ObjectMeta can be used when searching for CiliumIdentity instances that include particular labels. This can be done with invocations such as:     kubectl get ciliumid -l 'foo=bar'  Each node using a ciliumidentity updates the status field with it's name and a timestamp when it first allocates or uses an identity, and periodically after that. It deletes its entry when no longer using this identity. cilium-operator uses the list of nodes in status to reference count users of this identity, and to expire stale usage.

# k8s_cilium_io_cilium_identity_v2 (Resource)

CiliumIdentity is a CRD that represents an identity managed by Cilium. It is intended as a backing store for identity allocation, acting as the global coordination backend, and can be used in place of a KVStore (such as etcd). The name of the CRD is the numeric identity and the labels on the CRD object are the the kubernetes sourced labels seen by cilium. This is currently the only label source possible when running under kubernetes. Non-kubernetes labels are filtered but all labels, from all sources, are places in the SecurityLabels field. These also include the source and are used to define the identity. The labels under metav1.ObjectMeta can be used when searching for CiliumIdentity instances that include particular labels. This can be done with invocations such as:  	kubectl get ciliumid -l 'foo=bar'  Each node using a ciliumidentity updates the status field with it's name and a timestamp when it first allocates or uses an identity, and periodically after that. It deletes its entry when no longer using this identity. cilium-operator uses the list of nodes in status to reference count users of this identity, and to expire stale usage.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "k8s_cilium_io_cilium_identity_v2" "minimal" {
  metadata = {
    name = "test"
  }
  security_labels = {}
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `security_labels` (Map of String) SecurityLabels is the source-of-truth set of labels for this identity.

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.
