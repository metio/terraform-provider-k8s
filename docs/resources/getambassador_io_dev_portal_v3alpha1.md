# k8s_getambassador_io_dev_portal_v3alpha1 (Resource)

DevPortal is the Schema for the DevPortals API  DevPortal resources specify the 'what' and 'how' is shown in a DevPortal:   1. 'what' is in a DevPortal can be controlled with      - a 'selector', that can be used for filtering 'Mappings'.      - a 'docs' listing of (services, url)   2. 'how' is a pointer to some 'contents' (a checkout of a Git repository     with go-templates/markdown/css).  Multiple 'DevPortal's can exist in the cluster, and the Dev Portal server will show them at different endpoints. A 'DevPortal' resource with a special name, 'ambassador', will be used for configuring the default Dev Portal (served at '/docs/' by default).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "k8s_getambassador_io_dev_portal_v3alpha1" "minimal" {

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) DevPortalSpec defines the desired state of DevPortal (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

- `naming_scheme` (String) Describes how to display 'services' in the DevPortal. Default namespace.name
- `preserve_servers` (Boolean) Configures this DevPortal to use server definitions from the openAPI doc instead of rewriting them based on the url used for the connection.
