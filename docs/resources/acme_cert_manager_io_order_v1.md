    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
  spec = {
    issuer_ref = {
      group = "some-group"

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `issuer_ref` (Attributes) IssuerRef references a properly configured ACME-type Issuer which should be used to create this Order. If the Issuer does not exist, processing will be retried. If the Issuer is not an 'ACME' Issuer, an error will be returned and the Order will be marked as failed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--issuer_ref))
- `request` (String) Certificate signing request bytes in DER encoding. This will be used when finalizing the order. This field must be set on the order.

Optional:

- `common_name` (String) CommonName is the common name as specified on the DER encoded CSR. If specified, this value must also be present in 'dnsNames' or 'ipAddresses'. This field must match the corresponding field on the DER encoded CSR.
- `dns_names` (List of String) DNSNames is a list of DNS names that should be included as part of the Order validation process. This field must match the corresponding field on the DER encoded CSR.
- `duration` (String) Duration is the duration for the not after date for the requested certificate. this is set on order creation as pe the ACME spec.
