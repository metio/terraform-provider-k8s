# k8s_couchbase_com_couchbase_backup_v2 (Resource)

CouchbaseBackup allows automatic backup of all data from a Couchbase cluster into persistent storage.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "k8s_couchbase_com_couchbase_backup_v2" "minimal" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "test"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
  spec = {
    strategy = "full_incremental"
  }
}

resource "k8s_couchbase_com_couchbase_backup_v2" "example1" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "test"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
  spec = {
    strategy = "full_incremental"
    auto_scaling = {
      limit = 123
    }
  }
}

resource "k8s_couchbase_com_couchbase_backup_v2" "example2" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "test"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
  }
  spec = {
    strategy = "full_incremental"
    auto_scaling = {
      limit = "150Ki"
    }

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) CouchbaseBackupSpec is allows the specification of how a Couchbase backup is configured, including when backups are performed, how long they are retained for, and where they are backed up to. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `strategy` (String) Strategy defines how to perform backups.  'full_only' will only perform full backups, and you must define a schedule in the 'spec.full' field.  'full_incremental' will perform periodic full backups, and incremental backups in between.  You must define full and incremental schedules in the 'spec.full' and 'spec.incremental' fields respectively.  Care should be taken to ensure full and incremental schedules do not overlap, taking into account the backup time, as this will cause failures as the jobs attempt to mount the same backup volume. This field default to 'full_incremental'. Info: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/backup-restore/cbbackupmgr-strategies.html

Optional:

- `auto_scaling` (Attributes) AutoScaling allows the volume size to be dynamically increased. When specified, the backup volume will start with an initial size as defined by 'spec.size', and increase as required. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--auto_scaling))
- `backoff_limit` (Number) Number of times a backup job should try to execute. Once it hits the BackoffLimit it will not run until the next scheduled job.
- `backup_retention` (String) Number of hours to hold backups for, everything older will be deleted.  More info: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration
- `data` (Attributes) Data allows control over what key-value/document data is included in the backup.  By default, all data is included.  Modifications to this field will only take effect on the next full backup. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--data))
- `failed_jobs_history_limit` (Number) Amount of failed jobs to keep.
- `full` (Attributes) Full is the schedule on when to take full backups. Used in Full/Incremental and FullOnly backup strategies. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--full))
- `incremental` (Attributes) Incremental is the schedule on when to take incremental backups. Used in Full/Incremental backup strategies. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--incremental))
- `log_retention` (String) Number of hours to hold script logs for, everything older will be deleted.  More info: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration
- `s3bucket` (String) Name of S3 bucket to backup to. If non-empty this overrides local backup.
- `services` (Attributes) Services allows control over what services are included in the backup. By default, all service data and metadata are included.  Modifications to this field will only take effect on the next full backup. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--services))
- `size` (Dynamic) Size allows the specification of a backup persistent volume, when using volume based backup. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes
- `storage_class_name` (String) Name of StorageClass to use.
- `successful_jobs_history_limit` (Number) Amount of successful jobs to keep.
- `threads` (Number) How many threads to use during the backup.  This field defaults to 1.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--auto_scaling"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.auto_scaling`

Optional:

- `increment_percent` (Number) IncrementPercent controls how much the volume is increased each time the threshold is exceeded, upto a maximum as defined by the limit. This field defaults to 20 if not specified.
- `limit` (Dynamic) Limit imposes a hard limit on the size we can autoscale to.  When not specified no bounds are imposed. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes
- `threshold_percent` (Number) ThresholdPercent determines the point at which a volume is autoscaled. This represents the percentage of free space remaining on the volume, when less than this threshold, it will trigger a volume expansion. For example, if the volume is 100Gi, and the threshold 20%, then a resize will be triggered when the used capacity exceeds 80Gi, and free space is less than 20Gi.  This field defaults to 20 if not specified.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--data"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.data`

Optional:

- `exclude` (List of String) Exclude defines the buckets, scopes or collections that are excluded from the backup. When this field is set, it implies that by default everything will be backed up, and data items can be explicitly excluded.  You may define an exclusion as a bucket -- 'my-bucket', a scope -- 'my-bucket.my-scope', or a collection -- 'my-bucket.my-scope.my-collection'. Buckets may contain periods, and therefore must be escaped -- 'my.bucket.my-scope', as period is the separator used to delimit scopes and collections.  Excluded data cannot overlap e.g. specifying 'my-bucket' and 'my-bucket.my-scope' is illegal.  This field cannot be used at the same time as included items.
- `include` (List of String) Include defines the buckets, scopes or collections that are included in the backup. When this field is set, it implies that by default nothing will be backed up, and data items must be explicitly included.  You may define an inclusion as a bucket -- 'my-bucket', a scope -- 'my-bucket.my-scope', or a collection -- 'my-bucket.my-scope.my-collection'. Buckets may contain periods, and therefore must be escaped -- 'my.bucket.my-scope', as period is the separator used to delimit scopes and collections.  Included data cannot overlap e.g. specifying 'my-bucket' and 'my-bucket.my-scope' is illegal.  This field cannot be used at the same time as excluded items.
