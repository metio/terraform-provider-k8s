# k8s_cilium_io_cilium_bgp_peering_policy_v2alpha1 (Resource)

CiliumBGPPeeringPolicy is a Kubernetes third-party resource for instructing Cilium's BGP control plane to create virtual BGP routers.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "k8s_cilium_io_cilium_bgp_peering_policy_v2alpha1" "minimal" {
  metadata = {
    name = "test"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) Spec is a human readable description of a BGP peering policy (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `virtual_routers` (Attributes List) A list of CiliumBGPVirtualRouter(s) which instructs the BGP control plane how to instantiate virtual BGP routers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--virtual_routers))

Optional:

- `node_selector` (Attributes) NodeSelector selects a group of nodes where this BGP Peering Policy applies.  If nil this policy applies to all nodes. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--node_selector))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--virtual_routers"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.virtual_routers`

Required:

- `local_asn` (Number) LocalASN is the ASN of this virtual router. Supports extended 32bit ASNs
- `neighbors` (Attributes List) Neighbors is a list of neighboring BGP peers for this virtual router (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--virtual_routers--neighbors))

Optional:

- `export_pod_cidr` (Boolean) ExportPodCIDR determines whether to export the Node's private CIDR block to the configured neighbors.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--virtual_routers--neighbors"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.virtual_routers.neighbors`

Required:

- `peer_address` (String) PeerAddress is the IP address of the peer. This must be in CIDR notation and use a /32 to express a single host.
- `peer_asn` (Number) PeerASN is the ASN of the peer BGP router. Supports extended 32bit ASNs



<a id="nestedatt--spec--node_selector"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.node_selector`

Optional:

- `match_expressions` (Attributes List) matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--node_selector--match_expressions))
- `match_labels` (Map of String) matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--node_selector--match_expressions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.node_selector.match_expressions`

Required:

- `key` (String) key is the label key that the selector applies to.
- `operator` (String) operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

Optional:

- `values` (List of String) values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.
