### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `additional_alert_manager_configs` (Attributes) AdditionalAlertManagerConfigs allows specifying a key of a Secret containing additional Prometheus AlertManager configurations. AlertManager configurations specified are appended to the configurations generated by the Prometheus Operator. Job configurations specified must have the form as specified in the official Prometheus documentation: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#alertmanager_config. As AlertManager configs are appended, the user is responsible to make sure it is valid. Note that using this feature may expose the possibility to break upgrades of Prometheus. It is advised to review Prometheus release notes to ensure that no incompatible AlertManager configs are going to break Prometheus after the upgrade. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--additional_alert_manager_configs))
- `additional_alert_relabel_configs` (Attributes) AdditionalAlertRelabelConfigs allows specifying a key of a Secret containing additional Prometheus alert relabel configurations. Alert relabel configurations specified are appended to the configurations generated by the Prometheus Operator. Alert relabel configurations specified must have the form as specified in the official Prometheus documentation: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#alert_relabel_configs. As alert relabel configs are appended, the user is responsible to make sure it is valid. Note that using this feature may expose the possibility to break upgrades of Prometheus. It is advised to review Prometheus release notes to ensure that no incompatible alert relabel configs are going to break Prometheus after the upgrade. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--additional_alert_relabel_configs))
- `additional_args` (Attributes List) AdditionalArgs allows setting additional arguments for the Prometheus container. It is intended for e.g. activating hidden flags which are not supported by the dedicated configuration options yet. The arguments are passed as-is to the Prometheus container which may cause issues if they are invalid or not supported by the given Prometheus version. In case of an argument conflict (e.g. an argument which is already set by the operator itself) or when providing an invalid argument the reconciliation will fail and an error will be logged. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--additional_args))
- `additional_scrape_configs` (Attributes) AdditionalScrapeConfigs allows specifying a key of a Secret containing additional Prometheus scrape configurations. Scrape configurations specified are appended to the configurations generated by the Prometheus Operator. Job configurations specified must have the form as specified in the official Prometheus documentation: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config. As scrape configs are appended, the user is responsible to make sure it is valid. Note that using this feature may expose the possibility to break upgrades of Prometheus. It is advised to review Prometheus release notes to ensure that no incompatible scrape configs are going to break Prometheus after the upgrade. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--additional_scrape_configs))
- `affinity` (Attributes) If specified, the pod's scheduling constraints. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--affinity))
- `alerting` (Attributes) Define details regarding alerting. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--alerting))
- `allow_overlapping_blocks` (Boolean) AllowOverlappingBlocks enables vertical compaction and vertical query merge in Prometheus. This is still experimental in Prometheus so it may change in any upcoming release.
- `apiserver_config` (Attributes) APIServerConfig allows specifying a host and auth methods to access apiserver. If left empty, Prometheus is assumed to run inside of the cluster and will discover API servers automatically and use the pod's CA certificate and bearer token file at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--apiserver_config))
- `arbitrary_fs_access_through_s_ms` (Attributes) ArbitraryFSAccessThroughSMs configures whether configuration based on a service monitor can access arbitrary files on the file system of the Prometheus container e.g. bearer token files.

The ConfigMaps are mounted into /etc/prometheus/configmaps/<configmap-name> in the 'prometheus' container.
- `containers` (Attributes List) Containers allows injecting additional containers or modifying operator generated containers. This can be used to allow adding an authentication proxy to a Prometheus pod or to change the behavior of an operator generated container. Containers described here modify an operator generated container if they share the same name and modifications are done via a strategic merge patch. The current container names are: 'prometheus', 'config-reloader', and 'thanos-sidecar'. Overriding containers is entirely outside the scope of what the maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour may break at any time without notice. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--containers))
- `disable_compaction` (Boolean) Disable prometheus compaction.
- `enable_admin_api` (Boolean) Enable access to prometheus web admin API. Defaults to the value of 'false'. WARNING: Enabling the admin APIs enables mutating endpoints, to delete data, shutdown Prometheus, and more. Enabling this should be done with care and the user is advised to add additional authentication authorization via a proxy to ensure only clients authorized to perform these actions can do so. For more information see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#tsdb-admin-apis
- `enable_features` (List of String) Enable access to Prometheus disabled features. By default, no features are enabled.

For more information see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/disabled_features/
- `enable_remote_write_receiver` (Boolean) Enable Prometheus to be used as a receiver for the Prometheus remote write protocol. Defaults to the value of 'false'. WARNING: This is not considered an efficient way of ingesting samples. Use it with caution for specific low-volume use cases.

For more information see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#remote-write-receiver Only valid in Prometheus versions 2.33.0 and newer.
- `enforced_body_size_limit` (String) EnforcedBodySizeLimit defines the maximum size of uncompressed response body that will be accepted by Prometheus. Targets responding with a body larger than this many bytes will cause the scrape to fail. Example: 100MB. If defined, the limit will apply to all service/pod monitors and probes. This is an experimental feature, this behaviour could change or be removed in the future. Only valid in Prometheus versions 2.28.0 and newer.
- `enforced_label_limit` (Number) Per-scrape limit on number of labels that will be accepted for a sample. If more than this number of labels are present post metric-relabeling, the entire scrape will be treated as failed. 0 means no limit. Only valid in Prometheus versions 2.27.0 and newer.
- `enforced_label_name_length_limit` (Number) Per-scrape limit on length of labels name that will be accepted for a sample. If a label name is longer than this number post metric-relabeling, the entire scrape will be treated as failed. 0 means no limit. Only valid in Prometheus versions 2.27.0 and newer.
- `enforced_label_value_length_limit` (Number) Per-scrape limit on length of labels value that will be accepted for a sample. If a label value is longer than this number post metric-relabeling, the entire scrape will be treated as failed. 0 means no limit. Only valid in Prometheus versions 2.27.0 and newer.
- `enforced_namespace_label` (String) EnforcedNamespaceLabel If set, a label will be added to  1. all user-metrics (created by 'ServiceMonitor', 'PodMonitor' and 'Probe' objects) and 2. in all 'PrometheusRule' objects (except the ones excluded in 'prometheusRulesExcludedFromEnforce') to * alerting & recording rules and * the metrics used in their expressions ('expr').  Label name is this field's value. Label value is the namespace of the created object (mentioned above).
- `enforced_sample_limit` (Number) EnforcedSampleLimit defines global limit on number of scraped samples that will be accepted. This overrides any SampleLimit set per ServiceMonitor or/and PodMonitor. It is meant to be used by admins to enforce the SampleLimit to keep overall number of samples/series under the desired limit. Note that if SampleLimit is lower that value will be taken instead.
- `enforced_target_limit` (Number) EnforcedTargetLimit defines a global limit on the number of scraped targets.  This overrides any TargetLimit set per ServiceMonitor or/and PodMonitor.  It is meant to be used by admins to enforce the TargetLimit to keep the overall number of targets under the desired limit. Note that if TargetLimit is lower, that value will be taken instead, except if either value is zero, in which case the non-zero value will be used.  If both values are zero, no limit is enforced.
- `evaluation_interval` (String) Interval between consecutive evaluations. Default: '30s'
- `excluded_from_enforcement` (Attributes List) List of references to PodMonitor, ServiceMonitor, Probe and PrometheusRule objects to be excluded from enforcing a namespace label of origin.

- `init_containers` (Attributes List) InitContainers allows adding initContainers to the pod definition. Those can be used to e.g. fetch secrets for injection into the Prometheus configuration from external sources. Any errors during the execution of an initContainer will lead to a restart of the Pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/ InitContainers described here modify an operator generated init containers if they share the same name and modifications are done via a strategic merge patch. The current init container name is: 'init-config-reloader'. Overriding init containers is entirely outside the scope of what the maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour may break at any time without notice. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--init_containers))

- `query` (Attributes) QuerySpec defines the query command line flags when starting Prometheus. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--query))
- `query_log_file` (String) QueryLogFile specifies the file to which PromQL queries are logged. If the filename has an empty path, e.g. 'query.log', prometheus-operator will mount the file into an emptyDir volume at '/var/log/prometheus'. If a full path is provided, e.g. /var/log/prometheus/query.log, you must mount a volume in the specified directory and it must be writable. This is because the prometheus container runs with a read-only root filesystem for security reasons. Alternatively, the location can be set to a stdout location such as '/dev/stdout' to log query information to the default Prometheus log stream. This is only available in versions of Prometheus >= 2.16.0. For more details, see the Prometheus docs (https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/query-log/)

- `retention_size` (String) Maximum amount of disk space used by blocks.
- `route_prefix` (String) The route prefix Prometheus registers HTTP handlers for. This is useful, if using ExternalURL and a proxy is rewriting HTTP routes of a request, and the actual ExternalURL is still true, but the server serves requests under a different route prefix. For example for use with 'kubectl proxy'.

- `ports` (Attributes List) List of ports to expose from the container. Not specifying a port here DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the default '0.0.0.0' address inside a container will be accessible from the network. Modifying this array with strategic merge patch may corrupt the data. For more information See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108255. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--containers--ports))

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/ (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--containers--security_context))
- `startup_probe` (Attributes) StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--containers--startup_probe))

- `stdin_once` (Boolean) Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false
- `termination_message_path` (String) Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
- `termination_message_policy` (String) Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
- `tty` (Boolean) Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false.
- `volume_devices` (Attributes List) volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--containers--volume_devices))
- `volume_mounts` (Attributes List) Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--containers--volume_mounts))

Any port which is listening on the default '0.0.0.0' address inside a container will be accessible from the network. Modifying this array with strategic merge patch may corrupt the data. For more information See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108255. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--init_containers--ports))
- `readiness_probe` (Attributes) Periodic probe of container service readiness. Container will be removed from service endpoints if the probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--init_containers--readiness_probe))
- `resources` (Attributes) Compute Resources required by this container. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/ (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--init_containers--resources))
- `security_context` (Attributes) SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/ (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--init_containers--security_context))
- `startup_probe` (Attributes) StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--init_containers--startup_probe))
- `stdin` (Boolean) Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF. Default is false.
- `stdin_once` (Boolean) Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false
- `termination_message_path` (String) Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
- `termination_message_policy` (String) Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
- `tty` (Boolean) Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false.
- `volume_devices` (Attributes List) volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--init_containers--volume_devices))
- `volume_mounts` (Attributes List) Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--init_containers--volume_mounts))
- `working_dir` (String) Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's default will be used, which might be configured in the container image. Cannot be updated.

- `disable_mount_sub_path` (Boolean) Deprecated: subPath usage will be disabled by default in a future release, this option will become unnecessary. DisableMountSubPath allows to remove any subPath usage in volume mounts.
- `empty_dir` (Attributes) EmptyDirVolumeSource to be used by the Prometheus StatefulSets. If specified, used in place of any volumeClaimTemplate. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage--empty_dir))
- `ephemeral` (Attributes) EphemeralVolumeSource to be used by the Prometheus StatefulSets. This is a beta field in k8s 1.21, for lower versions, starting with k8s 1.19, it requires enabling the GenericEphemeralVolume feature gate. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/ephemeral-volumes/#generic-ephemeral-volumes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage--ephemeral))
- `volume_claim_template` (Attributes) A PVC spec to be used by the Prometheus StatefulSets. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage--volume_claim_template))

### Nested Schema for `spec.storage.empty_dir`

Optional:

- `medium` (String) medium represents what type of storage medium should back this directory. The default is '' which means to use the node's default medium. Must be an empty string (default) or Memory. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#emptydir
- `size_limit` (Dynamic) sizeLimit is the total amount of local storage required for this EmptyDir volume. The size limit is also applicable for memory medium. The maximum usage on memory medium EmptyDir would be the minimum value between the SizeLimit specified here and the sum of memory limits of all containers in a pod. The default is nil which means that the limit is undefined. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/volumes#emptydir


<a id="nestedatt--spec--storage--ephemeral"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.storage.ephemeral`

Optional:

- `volume_claim_template` (Attributes) Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume. The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the pod.  The name of the PVC will be '<pod name>-<volume name>' where '<volume name>' is the name from the 'PodSpec.Volumes' array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).  An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster.  This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes to the PVC after it has been created.  Required, must not be nil. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage--ephemeral--volume_claim_template))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--storage--ephemeral--volume_claim_template"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.storage.ephemeral.volume_claim_template`

Required:

- `spec` (Attributes) The specification for the PersistentVolumeClaim. The entire content is copied unchanged into the PVC that gets created from this template. The same fields as in a PersistentVolumeClaim are also valid here. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec))

Optional:

- `metadata` (Map of String) May contain labels and annotations that will be copied into the PVC when creating it. No other fields are allowed and will be rejected during validation.

If the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, this field will always have the same contents as the DataSourceRef field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source))
- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any local object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified. (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source_ref))
- `resources` (Attributes) resources represents the minimum resources the volume should have.

SubPathExpr and SubPath are mutually exclusive.



<a id="nestedatt--spec--tolerations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.tolerations`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
- `value` (String) Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--topology_spread_constraints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.topology_spread_constraints`

Required:

- `max_skew` (Number) MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule', it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |   P   | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway', it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
- `topology_key` (String) TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a 'bucket', and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is 'kubernetes.io/hostname', each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey is 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', each zone is a domain of that topology. It's a required field.
- `when_unsatisfiable` (String) WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location, but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the skew. A constraint is considered 'Unsatisfiable' for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate 'MaxSkew' on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

Optional:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--topology_spread_constraints--label_selector))
- `match_label_keys` (List of String) MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for the incoming pod. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.
- `min_domains` (Number) MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread treats 'global minimum' as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so 'global minimum' is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew.  This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `node_affinity_policy` (String) NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations. - Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.  If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy. This is a alpha-level feature enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
- `node_taints_policy` (String) NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included. - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.  If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy. This is a alpha-level feature enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--volumes--empty_dir"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.volumes.empty_dir`

Optional:

- `medium` (String) medium represents what type of storage medium should back this directory. The default is '' which means to use the node's default medium. Must be an empty string (default) or Memory. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#emptydir
- `size_limit` (Dynamic) sizeLimit is the total amount of local storage required for this EmptyDir volume. The size limit is also applicable for memory medium. The maximum usage on memory medium EmptyDir would be the minimum value between the SizeLimit specified here and the sum of memory limits of all containers in a pod. The default is nil which means that the limit is undefined. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/volumes#emptydir


<a id="nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.volumes.ephemeral`

Optional:

- `volume_claim_template` (Attributes) Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume. The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the pod.  The name of the PVC will be '<pod name>-<volume name>' where '<volume name>' is the name from the 'PodSpec.Volumes' array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).  An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster.  This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes to the PVC after it has been created.  Required, must not be nil. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.volumes.ephemeral.volume_claim_template`

The same fields as in a PersistentVolumeClaim are also valid here. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec))

Optional:

- `metadata` (Map of String) May contain labels and annotations that will be copied into the PVC when creating it. No other fields are allowed and will be rejected during validation.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.volumes.ephemeral.volume_claim_template.spec`

Optional:

- `access_modes` (List of String) accessModes contains the desired access modes the volume should have. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1
- `data_source` (Attributes) dataSource field can be used to specify either: * An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot) * An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source, it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source. If the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, this field will always have the same contents as the DataSourceRef field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source))
- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any local object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified. (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source_ref))
- `resources` (Attributes) resources represents the minimum resources the volume should have. If RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature is enabled users are allowed to specify resource requirements that are lower than previous value but must still be higher than capacity recorded in the status field of the claim.
