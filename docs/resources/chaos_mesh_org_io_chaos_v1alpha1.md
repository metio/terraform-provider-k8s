## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) IOChaosSpec defines the desired state of IOChaos (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `action` (String) Action defines the specific pod chaos action. Supported action: latency / fault / attrOverride / mistake
- `mode` (String) Mode defines the mode to run chaos action. Supported mode: one / all / fixed / fixed-percent / random-max-percent
- `selector` (Attributes) Selector is used to select pods that are used to inject chaos action. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--selector))
- `volume_path` (String) VolumePath represents the mount path of injected volume

Optional:

- `attr` (Attributes) Attr defines the overrided attribution (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--attr))
- `container_names` (List of String) ContainerNames indicates list of the name of affected container. If not set, the first container will be injected
- `delay` (String) Delay defines the value of I/O chaos action delay. A delay string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as '300ms'. Valid time units are 'ns', 'us' (or 'µs'), 'ms', 's', 'm', 'h'.
- `duration` (String) Duration represents the duration of the chaos action. It is required when the action is 'PodFailureAction'. A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as '300ms', '-1.5h' or '2h45m'. Valid time units are 'ns', 'us' (or 'µs'), 'ms', 's', 'm', 'h'.
- `errno` (Number) Errno defines the error code that returned by I/O action. refer to: https://www-numi.fnal.gov/offline_software/srt_public_context/WebDocs/Errors/unix_system_errors.html
- `methods` (List of String) Methods defines the I/O methods for injecting I/O chaos action. default: all I/O methods.
- `mistake` (Attributes) Mistake defines what types of incorrectness are injected to IO operations (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--mistake))
- `path` (String) Path defines the path of files for injecting I/O chaos action.
- `percent` (Number) Percent defines the percentage of injection errors and provides a number from 0-100. default: 100.
- `value` (String) Value is required when the mode is set to 'FixedMode' / 'FixedPercentMode' / 'RandomMaxPercentMode'. If 'FixedMode', provide an integer of pods to do chaos action. If 'FixedPercentMode', provide a number from 0-100 to specify the percent of pods the server can do chaos action. IF 'RandomMaxPercentMode',  provide a number from 0-100 to specify the max percent of pods to do chaos action
