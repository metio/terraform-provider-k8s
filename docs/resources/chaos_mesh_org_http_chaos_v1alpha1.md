## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `mode` (String) Mode defines the mode to run chaos action. Supported mode: one / all / fixed / fixed-percent / random-max-percent
- `selector` (Attributes) Selector is used to select pods that are used to inject chaos action. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--selector))
- `target` (String) Target is the object to be selected and injected.

Optional:

- `abort` (Boolean) Abort is a rule to abort a http session.
- `code` (Number) Code is a rule to select target by http status code in response.
- `delay` (String) Delay represents the delay of the target request/response. A duration string is a possibly unsigned sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as '300ms', '2h45m'. Valid time units are 'ns', 'us' (or 'Âµs'), 'ms', 's', 'm', 'h'.
- `duration` (String) Duration represents the duration of the chaos action.
- `method` (String) Method is a rule to select target by http method in request.
- `patch` (Attributes) Patch is a rule to patch some contents in target. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--patch))
- `path` (String) Path is a rule to select target by uri path in http request.
- `port` (Number) Port represents the target port to be proxy of.
- `replace` (Attributes) Replace is a rule to replace some contents in target. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--replace))
- `request_headers` (Map of String) RequestHeaders is a rule to select target by http headers in request. The key-value pairs represent header name and header value pairs.
- `response_headers` (Map of String) ResponseHeaders is a rule to select target by http headers in response. The key-value pairs represent header name and header value pairs.
- `value` (String) Value is required when the mode is set to 'FixedMode' / 'FixedPercentMode' / 'RandomMaxPercentMode'. If 'FixedMode', provide an integer of pods to do chaos action. If 'FixedPercentMode', provide a number from 0-100 to specify the percent of pods the server can do chaos action. IF 'RandomMaxPercentMode',  provide a number from 0-100 to specify the max percent of pods to do chaos action

### Nested Schema for `spec.selector`

Optional:

- `annotation_selectors` (Map of String) Map of string keys and values that can be used to select objects. A selector based on annotations.
