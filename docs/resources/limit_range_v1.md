# k8s_limit_range_v1 (Resource)

LimitRange sets resource usage limits for each kind of resource in a Namespace.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "k8s_limit_range_v1" "minimal" {
  metadata = {
    name = "test"
  }
}

resource "k8s_limit_range_v1" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name = "test"
  }
  spec = {
    limits = [
      {
        type = "Pod"
        max = {
          cpu    = "200m"
          memory = "1024Mi"
        }
      },
      {
        type = "PersistentVolumeClaim"
        min = {
          storage = "24M"
        }
      },
      {
        type = "Container"
        default = {
          cpu    = "50m"
          memory = "24Mi"
        }
      },
    ]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) LimitRangeSpec defines a min/max usage limit for resources that match on kind. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `limits` (Attributes List) Limits is the list of LimitRangeItem objects that are enforced. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--limits))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--limits"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.limits`

Required:

- `type` (String) Type of resource that this limit applies to.

Optional:

- `default` (Map of String) Default resource requirement limit value by resource name if resource limit is omitted.
- `default_request` (Map of String) DefaultRequest is the default resource requirement request value by resource name if resource request is omitted.
- `max` (Map of String) Max usage constraints on this kind by resource name.
- `max_limit_request_ratio` (Map of String) MaxLimitRequestRatio if specified, the named resource must have a request and limit that are both non-zero where limit divided by request is less than or equal to the enumerated value; this represents the max burst for the named resource.
- `min` (Map of String) Min usage constraints on this kind by resource name.
