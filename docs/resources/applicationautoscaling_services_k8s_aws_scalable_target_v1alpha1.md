## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) ScalableTargetSpec defines the desired state of ScalableTarget.  Represents a scalable target. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

- `service_namespace` (String) The namespace of the Amazon Web Services service that provides the resource. For a resource provided by your own application or service, use custom-resource instead.

Optional:

- `max_capacity` (Number) The maximum value that you plan to scale out to. When a scaling policy is in effect, Application Auto Scaling can scale out (expand) as needed to the maximum capacity limit in response to changing demand. This property is required when registering a new scalable target.  Although you can specify a large maximum capacity, note that service quotas may impose lower limits. Each service has its own default quotas for the maximum capacity of the resource. If you want to specify a higher limit, you can request an increase. For more information, consult the documentation for that service. For information about the default quotas for each service, see Service Endpoints and Quotas (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
- `min_capacity` (Number) The minimum value that you plan to scale in to. When a scaling policy is in effect, Application Auto Scaling can scale in (contract) as needed to the minimum capacity limit in response to changing demand. This property is required when registering a new scalable target.  For certain resources, the minimum value allowed is 0. This includes Lambda provisioned concurrency, Spot Fleet, ECS services, Aurora DB clusters, EMR clusters, and custom resources. For all other resources, the minimum value allowed is 1.
- `role_arn` (String) This parameter is required for services that do not support service-linked roles (such as Amazon EMR), and it must specify the ARN of an IAM role that allows Application Auto Scaling to modify the scalable target on your behalf.  If the service supports service-linked roles, Application Auto Scaling uses a service-linked role, which it creates if it does not yet exist. For more information, see Application Auto Scaling IAM roles (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-roles).
- `suspended_state` (Attributes) An embedded object that contains attributes and attribute values that are used to suspend and resume automatic scaling. Setting the value of an attribute to true suspends the specified scaling activities. Setting it to false (default) resumes the specified scaling activities.  Suspension Outcomes  * For DynamicScalingInSuspended, while a suspension is in effect, all scale-in activities that are triggered by a scaling policy are suspended.  * For DynamicScalingOutSuspended, while a suspension is in effect, all scale-out activities that are triggered by a scaling policy are suspended.  * For ScheduledScalingSuspended, while a suspension is in effect, all scaling activities that involve scheduled actions are suspended.  For more information, see Suspending and resuming scaling (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-suspend-resume-scaling.html) in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--suspended_state))
