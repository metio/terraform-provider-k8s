## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) RedisEnterpriseDatabaseSpec defines the desired state of RedisEnterpriseDatabase (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.

<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `active_active_name` (String) The Redis Enterprise Active Active Peering custom resource name this Resource is associated with, also, the corresponding active active database name. In case this resource is created manually at the active active database creation this field must be filled via the user, otherwise, the operator will assign this field automatically. Note: this feature is currently unsupported.
- `alert_settings` (Attributes) Settings for database alerts (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--alert_settings))

- `data_internode_encryption` (Boolean) Internode encryption (INE) setting. An optional boolean setting, overriding a similar cluster-wide policy. If set to False, INE is guaranteed to be turned off for this DB (regardless of cluster-wide policy). If set to True, INE will be turned on, unless the capability is not supported by the DB ( in such a case we will get an error and database creation will fail). If left unspecified, will be disabled if internode encryption is not supported by the DB (regardless of cluster default). Deleting this property after explicitly setting its value shall have no effect.
- `database_port` (Number) Database port number. TCP port on which the database is available. Will be generated automatically if omitted. can not be changed after creation
- `database_secret_name` (String) The name of the K8s secret that holds the password to the database.

- `eviction_policy` (String) Database eviction policy. see more https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/administering/database-operations/eviction-policy/
- `global_configurations` (Boolean) Flag that determines if this is the default global configurations for active active database. In case this resource is created manually at the active active database creation this field must be filled via the user otherwise the operator will create the global configurations REDB automatically with default values. Note: this feature is currently unsupported.
- `is_rof` (Boolean) Whether it is an RoF database or not. Applicable only for databases of type 'REDIS'. Assumed to be false if left blank.
- `memcached_sasl_secret_name` (String) Credentials used for binary authentication in memcached databases. The credentials should be saved as an opaque secret and the name of that secret should be configured using this field. For username, use 'username' as the key and the actual username as the value. For password, use 'password' as the key and the actual password as the value. Note that connections are not encrypted.
- `memory_size` (String) memory size of database. use formats like 100MB, 0.1GB. minimum value in 100MB. When redis on flash (RoF) is enabled, this value refers to RAM+Flash memory, and it must not be below 1GB.
- `modules_list` (Attributes List) List of modules associated with database (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--modules_list))
- `oss_cluster` (Boolean) OSS Cluster mode option. Note that not all client libraries support OSS cluster mode.
- `persistence` (String) Database on-disk persistence policy
- `proxy_policy` (String) The policy used for proxy binding to the endpoint. Supported proxy policies are: single/all-master-shards/all-nodes When left blank, the default value will be chosen according to the value of ossCluster - single if disabled, all-master-shards when enabled
- `rack_aware` (Boolean) Whether database should be rack aware. This improves availability - more information: https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/concepts/high-availability/rack-zone-awareness/

If set to 'major' - will always upgrade to the most recent major Redis version. If set to 'latest' - will always upgrade to the most recent Redis version. Depends on 'redisUpgradePolicy' - if you want to set the value to 'latest' for some databases, you must set redisUpgradePolicy on the cluster before. Possible values are 'major' or 'latest' When using upgrade - make sure to backup the database before. This value is used only for database type 'redis'
- `replica_sources` (Attributes List) What databases to replicate from (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--replica_sources))
- `replication` (Boolean) In-memory database replication. When enabled, database will have replica shard for every master - leading to higher availability.
