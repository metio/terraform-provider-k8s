## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) HostSpec defines the desired state of Host (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `acme_provider` (Attributes) Specifies whether/who to talk ACME with to automatically manage the $tlsSecret. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--acme_provider))
- `ambassador_id` (List of String) Common to all Ambassador objects (and optional).
- `hostname` (String) Hostname by which the Ambassador can be reached.
- `mapping_selector` (Attributes) Selector for Mappings we'll associate with this Host. At the moment, Selector and MappingSelector are synonyms, but that will change soon. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--mapping_selector))
- `preview_url` (Attributes) Configuration for the Preview URL feature of Service Preview. Defaults to preview URLs not enabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--preview_url))
- `request_policy` (Attributes) Request policy definition. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--request_policy))
- `selector` (Attributes) DEPRECATED: Selector by which we can find further configuration. Use MappingSelector instead.  TODO(lukeshu): In v3alpha2, figure out how to get rid of HostSpec.DeprecatedSelector. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--selector))
- `tls` (Attributes) TLS configuration.  It is not valid to specify both 'tlsContext' and 'tls'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--tls))
- `tls_context` (Attributes) Name of the TLSContext the Host resource is linked with. It is not valid to specify both 'tlsContext' and 'tls'.  Note that this is a native-Kubernetes-style core.v1.LocalObjectReference, not an Ambassador-style '{name}.{namespace}' string.  Because we're opinionated, it does not support referencing a Secret in another namespace (because most native Kubernetes resources don't support that), but if we ever abandon that opinion and decide to support non-local references it, it would be by adding a 'namespace:' field by changing it from a core.v1.LocalObjectReference to a core.v1.SecretReference, not by adopting the '{name}.{namespace}' notation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--tls_context))
- `tls_secret` (Attributes) Name of the Kubernetes secret into which to save generated certificates.  If ACME is enabled (see $acmeProvider), then the default is $hostname; otherwise the default is ''.  If the value is '', then we do not do TLS for this Host. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--tls_secret))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--acme_provider"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.acme_provider`

Optional:

- `authority` (String) Specifies who to talk ACME with to get certs. Defaults to Let's Encrypt; if 'none' (case-insensitive), do not try to do ACME for this Host.
- `email` (String)
- `private_key_secret` (Attributes) Specifies the Kubernetes Secret to use to store the private key of the ACME account (essentially, where to store the auto-generated password for the auto-created ACME account).  You should not normally need to set this--the default value is based on a combination of the ACME authority being registered wit and the email address associated with the account.  Note that this is a native-Kubernetes-style core.v1.LocalObjectReference, not an Ambassador-style '{name}.{namespace}' string.  Because we're opinionated, it does not support referencing a Secret in another namespace (because most native Kubernetes resources don't support that), but if we ever abandon that opinion and decide to support non-local references it, it would be by adding a 'namespace:' field by changing it from a core.v1.LocalObjectReference to a core.v1.SecretReference, not by adopting the '{name}.{namespace}' notation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--acme_provider--private_key_secret))
- `registration` (String) This is normally set automatically
