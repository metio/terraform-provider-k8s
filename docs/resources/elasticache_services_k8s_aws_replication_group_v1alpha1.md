## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) ReplicationGroupSpec defines the desired state of ReplicationGroup.  Contains all of the attributes of a specific Redis replication group. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

- `cache_parameter_group_name` (String) The name of the parameter group to associate with this replication group. If this argument is omitted, the default cache parameter group for the specified engine is used.  If you are running Redis version 3.2.4 or later, only one node group (shard), and want to use a default parameter group, we recommend that you specify the parameter group by name.     * To create a Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication group, use CacheParameterGroupName=default.redis3.2.     * To create a Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group, use CacheParameterGroupName=default.redis3.2.cluster.on.

- `cache_subnet_group_name` (String) The name of the cache subnet group to be used for the replication group.

For more information, see Subnets and Subnet Groups (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/SubnetGroups.html).
- `engine` (String) The name of the cache engine to be used for the clusters in this replication group. Must be Redis.
- `engine_version` (String) The version number of the cache engine to be used for the clusters in this replication group. To view the supported cache engine versions, use the DescribeCacheEngineVersions operation.  Important: You can upgrade to a newer engine version (see Selecting a Cache Engine and Version (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/SelectEngine.html#VersionManagement)) in the ElastiCache User Guide, but you cannot downgrade to an earlier engine version. If you want to use an earlier engine version, you must delete the existing cluster or replication group and create it anew with the earlier engine version.

- `node_group_configuration` (Attributes List) A list of node group (shard) configuration options. Each node group (shard) configuration has the following members: PrimaryAvailabilityZone, ReplicaAvailabilityZones, ReplicaCount, and Slots.  If you're creating a Redis (cluster mode disabled) or a Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group, you can use this parameter to individually configure each node group (shard), or you can omit this parameter. However, it is required when seeding a Redis (cluster mode enabled) cluster from a S3 rdb file. You must configure each node group (shard) using this parameter because you must specify the slots for each node group. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--node_group_configuration))
- `notification_topic_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic to which notifications are sent.  The Amazon SNS topic owner must be the same as the cluster owner.

- `port` (Number) The port number on which each member of the replication group accepts connections.
- `preferred_cache_cluster_a_zs` (List of String) A list of EC2 Availability Zones in which the replication group's clusters are created. The order of the Availability Zones in the list is the order in which clusters are allocated. The primary cluster is created in the first AZ in the list.  This parameter is not used if there is more than one node group (shard). You should use NodeGroupConfiguration instead.  If you are creating your replication group in an Amazon VPC (recommended), you can only locate clusters in Availability Zones associated with the subnets in the selected subnet group.  The number of Availability Zones listed must equal the value of NumCacheClusters.  Default: system chosen Availability Zones.
- `preferred_maintenance_window` (String) Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on the cluster is performed. It is specified as a range in the format ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). The minimum maintenance window is a 60 minute period. Valid values for ddd are:  Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on the cluster is performed. It is specified as a range in the format ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). The minimum maintenance window is a 60 minute period.  Valid values for ddd are:     * sun     * mon     * tue     * wed     * thu     * fri     * sat  Example: sun:23:00-mon:01:30
- `primary_cluster_id` (String) The identifier of the cluster that serves as the primary for this replication group. This cluster must already exist and have a status of available.  This parameter is not required if NumCacheClusters, NumNodeGroups, or ReplicasPerNodeGroup is specified.
- `replicas_per_node_group` (Number) An optional parameter that specifies the number of replica nodes in each node group (shard). Valid values are 0 to 5.
- `security_group_i_ds` (List of String) One or more Amazon VPC security groups associated with this replication group.  Use this parameter only when you are creating a replication group in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

The snapshot files are used to populate the new replication group. The Amazon S3 object name in the ARN cannot contain any commas. The new replication group will have the number of node groups (console: shards) specified by the parameter NumNodeGroups or the number of node groups configured by NodeGroupConfiguration regardless of the number of ARNs specified here.  Example of an Amazon S3 ARN: arn:aws:s3:::my_bucket/snapshot1.rdb
- `snapshot_name` (String) The name of a snapshot from which to restore data into the new replication group. The snapshot status changes to restoring while the new replication group is being created.
- `snapshot_retention_limit` (Number) The number of days for which ElastiCache retains automatic snapshots before deleting them. For example, if you set SnapshotRetentionLimit to 5, a snapshot that was taken today is retained for 5 days before being deleted.  Default: 0 (i.e., automatic backups are disabled for this cluster).
- `snapshot_window` (String) The daily time range (in UTC) during which ElastiCache begins taking a daily snapshot of your node group (shard).  Example: 05:00-09:00  If you do not specify this parameter, ElastiCache automatically chooses an appropriate time range.
- `tags` (Attributes List) A list of tags to be added to this resource. Tags are comma-separated key,value pairs (e.g. Key=myKey, Value=myKeyValue. You can include multiple tags as shown following: Key=myKey, Value=myKeyValue Key=mySecondKey, Value=mySecondKeyValue. Tags on replication groups will be replicated to all nodes. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--tags))
- `transit_encryption_enabled` (Boolean) A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to true.  You cannot modify the value of TransitEncryptionEnabled after the cluster is created. To enable in-transit encryption on a cluster you must set TransitEncryptionEnabled to true when you create a cluster.  This parameter is valid only if the Engine parameter is redis, the EngineVersion parameter is 3.2.6, 4.x or later, and the cluster is being created in an Amazon VPC.  If you enable in-transit encryption, you must also specify a value for CacheSubnetGroup.  Required: Only available when creating a replication group in an Amazon VPC using redis version 3.2.6, 4.x or later.  Default: false  For HIPAA compliance, you must specify TransitEncryptionEnabled as true, an AuthToken, and a CacheSubnetGroup.
- `user_group_i_ds` (List of String) The user group to associate with the replication group.
