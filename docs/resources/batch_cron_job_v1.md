- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `field_manager` (Boolean) The name of the manager used to track field ownership. If not specified uses the value from the provider configuration.
- `force_conflicts` (Boolean) If `true`, server-side apply will force the changes against conflicts. If not specified uses the value from the provider configuration.
- `spec` (Attributes) CronJobSpec describes how the job execution will look like and when it will actually run. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))
- `wait_for` (Attributes List) Wait for specific conditions after create/update of resources. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--wait_for))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `job_template` (Attributes) JobTemplateSpec describes the data a Job should have when created from a template (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template))
- `schedule` (String) The schedule in Cron format, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron.

Optional:

- `concurrency_policy` (String) Specifies how to treat concurrent executions of a Job. Valid values are: - 'Allow' (default): allows CronJobs to run concurrently; - 'Forbid': forbids concurrent runs, skipping next run if previous run hasn't finished yet; - 'Replace': cancels currently running job and replaces it with a new one
- `failed_jobs_history_limit` (Number) The number of failed finished jobs to retain. Value must be non-negative integer. Defaults to 1.
- `starting_deadline_seconds` (Number) Optional deadline in seconds for starting the job if it misses scheduled time for any reason.  Missed jobs executions will be counted as failed ones.
- `successful_jobs_history_limit` (Number) The number of successful finished jobs to retain. Value must be non-negative integer. Defaults to 3.

- `time_zone` (String) The time zone name for the given schedule, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones. If not specified, this will default to the time zone of the kube-controller-manager process. The set of valid time zone names and the time zone offset is loaded from the system-wide time zone database by the API server during CronJob validation and the controller manager during execution. If no system-wide time zone database can be found a bundled version of the database is used instead. If the time zone name becomes invalid during the lifetime of a CronJob or due to a change in host configuration, the controller will stop creating new new Jobs and will create a system event with the reason UnknownTimeZone. More information can be found in https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/#time-zones This is beta field and must be enabled via the 'CronJobTimeZone' feature gate.

### Nested Schema for `spec.job_template`

Optional:

- `metadata` (Attributes) ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) JobSpec describes how the job execution will look like. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--job_template--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.job_template.metadata`

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
- `creation_timestamp` (String) Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.
- `deletion_grace_period_seconds` (Number) Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
- `deletion_timestamp` (String) Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.
- `finalizers` (List of String) Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.
- `generate_name` (String) GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will return a 409.Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency
- `generation` (Number) A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only.
- `labels` (Map of String) Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
- `managed_fields` (Attributes List) ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like 'ci-cd'. The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--metadata--managed_fields))
- `name` (String) Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
- `namespace` (String) Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the 'default' namespace, but 'default' is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
- `owner_references` (Attributes List) List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--metadata--owner_references))
- `resource_version` (String) An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
- `self_link` (String) Deprecated: selfLink is a legacy read-only field that is no longer populated by the system.
- `uid` (String) UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

<a id="nestedatt--spec--job_template--metadata--managed_fields"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.job_template.metadata.uid`

Optional:

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is 'group/version' just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.
- `fields_type` (String) FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: 'FieldsV1'
- `fields_v1` (Map of String) FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set, or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats: 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item 'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.The exact format is defined in sigs.k8s.io/structured-merge-diff
- `manager` (String) Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.
- `operation` (String) Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry being created. The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.
- `subresource` (String) Subresource is the name of the subresource used to update that object, or empty string if the object was updated through the main resource. The value of this field is used to distinguish between managers, even if they share the same name. For example, a status update will be distinct from a regular update using the same manager name. Note that the APIVersion field is not related to the Subresource field and it always corresponds to the version of the main resource.
- `time` (String) Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--job_template--metadata--owner_references"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.job_template.metadata.uid`

Required:

- `api_version` (String) API version of the referent.
- `kind` (String) Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `name` (String) Name of the referent. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
- `uid` (String) UID of the referent. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

Optional:

- `block_owner_deletion` (Boolean) If true, AND if the owner has the 'foregroundDeletion' finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/garbage-collection/#foreground-deletion for how the garbage collector interacts with this field and enforces the foreground deletion. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs 'delete' permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.
- `controller` (Boolean) If true, this reference points to the managing controller.



<a id="nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.job_template.spec`

Required:

- `template` (Attributes) PodTemplateSpec describes the data a pod should have when created from a template (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--template))

Optional:

- `active_deadline_seconds` (Number) Specifies the duration in seconds relative to the startTime that the job may be continuously active before the system tries to terminate it; value must be positive integer. If a Job is suspended (at creation or through an update), this timer will effectively be stopped and reset when the Job is resumed again.
- `backoff_limit` (Number) Specifies the number of retries before marking this job failed. Defaults to 6
- `completion_mode` (String) CompletionMode specifies how Pod completions are tracked. It can be 'NonIndexed' (default) or 'Indexed'.'NonIndexed' means that the Job is considered complete when there have been .spec.completions successfully completed Pods. Each Pod completion is homologous to each other.'Indexed' means that the Pods of a Job get an associated completion index from 0 to (.spec.completions - 1), available in the annotation batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index. The Job is considered complete when there is one successfully completed Pod for each index. When value is 'Indexed', .spec.completions must be specified and '.spec.parallelism' must be less than or equal to 10^5. In addition, The Pod name takes the form '$(job-name)-$(index)-$(random-string)', the Pod hostname takes the form '$(job-name)-$(index)'.More completion modes can be added in the future. If the Job controller observes a mode that it doesn't recognize, which is possible during upgrades due to version skew, the controller skips updates for the Job.
- `completions` (Number) Specifies the desired number of successfully finished pods the job should be run with.  Setting to nil means that the success of any pod signals the success of all pods, and allows parallelism to have any positive value.  Setting to 1 means that parallelism is limited to 1 and the success of that pod signals the success of the job. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/
- `manual_selector` (Boolean) manualSelector controls generation of pod labels and pod selectors. Leave 'manualSelector' unset unless you are certain what you are doing. When false or unset, the system pick labels unique to this job and appends those labels to the pod template.  When true, the user is responsible for picking unique labels and specifying the selector.  Failure to pick a unique label may cause this and other jobs to not function correctly.  However, You may see 'manualSelector=true' in jobs that were created with the old 'extensions/v1beta1' API. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/#specifying-your-own-pod-selector
- `parallelism` (Number) Specifies the maximum desired number of pods the job should run at any given time. The actual number of pods running in steady state will be less than this number when ((.spec.completions - .status.successful) < .spec.parallelism), i.e. when the work left to do is less than max parallelism. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/
- `pod_failure_policy` (Attributes) PodFailurePolicy describes how failed pods influence the backoffLimit. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--pod_failure_policy))
- `selector` (Attributes) A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--selector))
- `suspend` (Boolean) Suspend specifies whether the Job controller should create Pods or not. If a Job is created with suspend set to true, no Pods are created by the Job controller. If a Job is suspended after creation (i.e. the flag goes from false to true), the Job controller will delete all active Pods associated with this Job. Users must design their workload to gracefully handle this. Suspending a Job will reset the StartTime field of the Job, effectively resetting the ActiveDeadlineSeconds timer too. Defaults to false.
- `ttl_seconds_after_finished` (Number) ttlSecondsAfterFinished limits the lifetime of a Job that has finished execution (either Complete or Failed). If this field is set, ttlSecondsAfterFinished after the Job finishes, it is eligible to be automatically deleted. When the Job is being deleted, its lifecycle guarantees (e.g. finalizers) will be honored. If this field is unset, the Job won't be automatically deleted. If this field is set to zero, the Job becomes eligible to be deleted immediately after it finishes.

Optional:

- `active_deadline_seconds` (Number) Optional duration in seconds the pod may be active on the node relative to StartTime before the system will actively try to mark it failed and kill associated containers. Value must be a positive integer.
- `affinity` (Attributes) Affinity is a group of affinity scheduling rules. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--spec--affinity))
- `automount_service_account_token` (Boolean) AutomountServiceAccountToken indicates whether a service account token should be automatically mounted.
- `dns_config` (Attributes) PodDNSConfig defines the DNS parameters of a pod in addition to those generated from DNSPolicy. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--spec--dns_config))
- `dns_policy` (String) Set DNS policy for the pod. Defaults to 'ClusterFirst'. Valid values are 'ClusterFirstWithHostNet', 'ClusterFirst', 'Default' or 'None'. DNS parameters given in DNSConfig will be merged with the policy selected with DNSPolicy. To have DNS options set along with hostNetwork, you have to specify DNS policy explicitly to 'ClusterFirstWithHostNet'.
- `enable_service_links` (Boolean) EnableServiceLinks indicates whether information about services should be injected into pod's environment variables, matching the syntax of Docker links. Optional: Defaults to true.
- `ephemeral_containers` (Attributes List) List of ephemeral containers run in this pod. Ephemeral containers may be run in an existing pod to perform user-initiated actions such as debugging. This list cannot be specified when creating a pod, and it cannot be modified by updating the pod spec.

When set to false, a new userns is created for the pod. Setting false is useful for mitigating container breakout vulnerabilities even allowing users to run their containers as root without actually having root privileges on the host. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the UserNamespacesSupport feature.

- `image_pull_secrets` (Attributes List) ImagePullSecrets is an optional list of references to secrets in the same namespace to use for pulling any of the images used by this PodSpec. If specified, these secrets will be passed to individual puller implementations for them to use. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--spec--image_pull_secrets))
- `init_containers` (Attributes List) List of initialization containers belonging to the pod. Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be unique among all containers. Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes. The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of of that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers in a similar fashion. Init containers cannot currently be added or removed. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/ (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--spec--init_containers))

- `node_selector` (Map of String) NodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the pod to fit on a node. Selector which must match a node's labels for the pod to be scheduled on that node. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/
- `os` (Attributes) PodOS defines the OS parameters of a pod. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--spec--os))
- `overhead` (Map of String) Overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for a given RuntimeClass. This field will be autopopulated at admission time by the RuntimeClass admission controller. If the RuntimeClass admission controller is enabled, overhead must not be set in Pod create requests. The RuntimeClass admission controller will reject Pod create requests which have the overhead already set. If RuntimeClass is configured and selected in the PodSpec, Overhead will be set to the value defined in the corresponding RuntimeClass, otherwise it will remain unset and treated as zero. More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/688-pod-overhead/README.md
- `preemption_policy` (String) PreemptionPolicy is the Policy for preempting pods with lower priority. One of Never, PreemptLowerPriority. Defaults to PreemptLowerPriority if unset.
- `priority` (Number) The priority value. Various system components use this field to find the priority of the pod. When Priority Admission Controller is enabled, it prevents users from setting this field. The admission controller populates this field from PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher the priority.
- `priority_class_name` (String) If specified, indicates the pod's priority. 'system-node-critical' and 'system-cluster-critical' are two special keywords which indicate the highest priorities with the former being the highest priority. Any other name must be defined by creating a PriorityClass object with that name. If not specified, the pod priority will be default or zero if there is no default.
- `readiness_gates` (Attributes List) If specified, all readiness gates will be evaluated for pod readiness. A pod is ready when all its containers are ready AND all conditions specified in the readiness gates have status equal to 'True' More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-network/580-pod-readiness-gates (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--spec--readiness_gates))

- `runtime_class_name` (String) RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io group, which should be used to run this pod.  If no RuntimeClass resource matches the named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, the 'legacy' RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an empty definition that uses the default runtime handler. More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/585-runtime-class
- `scheduler_name` (String) If specified, the pod will be dispatched by specified scheduler. If not specified, the pod will be dispatched by default scheduler.
- `scheduling_gates` (Attributes List) SchedulingGates is an opaque list of values that if specified will block scheduling the pod. More info:  https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-scheduling/3521-pod-scheduling-readiness.This is an alpha-level feature enabled by PodSchedulingReadiness feature gate. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--spec--scheduling_gates))

- `set_hostname_as_fqdn` (Boolean) If true the pod's hostname will be configured as the pod's FQDN, rather than the leaf name (the default). In Linux containers, this means setting the FQDN in the hostname field of the kernel (the nodename field of struct utsname). In Windows containers, this means setting the registry value of hostname for the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesTcpipParameters to FQDN. If a pod does not have FQDN, this has no effect. Default to false.
- `share_process_namespace` (Boolean) Share a single process namespace between all of the containers in a pod. When this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes from other containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both be set. Optional: Default to false.
- `subdomain` (String) If specified, the fully qualified Pod hostname will be '<hostname>.<subdomain>.<pod namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>'. If not specified, the pod will not have a domainname at all.
- `termination_grace_period_seconds` (Number) Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully. May be decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). If this value is nil, the default grace period will be used instead. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. Defaults to 30 seconds.
- `tolerations` (Attributes List) If specified, the pod's tolerations. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--spec--tolerations))

Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--spec--volumes--env_from))
- `image` (String) Container image name. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images This field is optional to allow higher level config management to default or override container images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.
- `image_pull_policy` (String) Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images

For more information See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108255. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--spec--volumes--ports))

- `stdin_once` (Boolean) Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false
- `termination_message_path` (String) Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
- `termination_message_policy` (String) Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
- `tty` (Boolean) Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false.

If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. '$$(VAR_NAME)' will produce the string literal '$(VAR_NAME)'. Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Defaults to ''.

- `divisor` (String) Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.The serialization format is:''' <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>	(Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the '' case in <decimalSI>.)<digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= '+' | '-' <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei	(International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)<decimalSI>       ::= m | '' | k | M | G | T | P | E	(Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)<decimalExponent> ::= 'e' <signedNumber> | 'E' <signedNumber> '''No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.Before serializing, Quantity will be put in 'canonical form'. This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:- No precision is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.Examples:- 1.5 will be serialized as '1500m' - 1.5Gi will be serialized as '1536Mi'Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

- `stdin_once` (Boolean) Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions.

- `target_container_name` (String) If set, the name of the container from PodSpec that this ephemeral container targets. The ephemeral container will be run in the namespaces (IPC, PID, etc) of this container. If not set then the ephemeral container uses the namespaces configured in the Pod spec.The container runtime must implement support for this feature. If the runtime does not support namespace targeting then the result of setting this field is undefined.
- `termination_message_path` (String) Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem.

The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
- `termination_message_policy` (String) Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.

- `divisor` (String) Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.The serialization format is:''' <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>	(Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the '' case in <decimalSI>.)<digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= '+' | '-' <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei	(International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)<decimalSI>       ::= m | '' | k | M | G | T | P | E	(Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)<decimalExponent> ::= 'e' <signedNumber> | 'E' <signedNumber> '''No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.Before serializing, Quantity will be put in 'canonical form'. This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:- No precision is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.Examples:- 1.5 will be serialized as '1500m' - 1.5Gi will be serialized as '1536Mi'Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

- `stdin_once` (Boolean) Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false
- `termination_message_path` (String) Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
- `termination_message_policy` (String) Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
- `tty` (Boolean) Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false.

- `divisor` (String) Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.The serialization format is:''' <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>	(Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the '' case in <decimalSI>.)<digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= '+' | '-' <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei	(International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)<decimalSI>       ::= m | '' | k | M | G | T | P | E	(Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)<decimalExponent> ::= 'e' <signedNumber> | 'E' <signedNumber> '''No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.Before serializing, Quantity will be put in 'canonical form'. This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:- No precision is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.Examples:- 1.5 will be serialized as '1500m' - 1.5Gi will be serialized as '1536Mi'Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

- `gmsa_credential_spec_name` (String) GMSACredentialSpecName is the name of the GMSA credential spec to use.
- `host_process` (Boolean) HostProcess determines if a container should be run as a 'Host Process' container. This field is alpha-level and will only be honored by components that enable the WindowsHostProcessContainers feature flag. Setting this field without the feature flag will result in errors when validating the Pod.

### Nested Schema for `spec.job_template.spec.ttl_seconds_after_finished.spec.volumes`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
- `value` (String) Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--spec--topology_spread_constraints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.job_template.spec.ttl_seconds_after_finished.spec.volumes`

Required:

- `max_skew` (Number) MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule', it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |   P   | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway', it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
- `topology_key` (String) TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a 'bucket', and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is 'kubernetes.io/hostname', each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey is 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', each zone is a domain of that topology. It's a required field.
- `when_unsatisfiable` (String) WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the  skew.A constraint is considered 'Unsatisfiable' for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate 'MaxSkew' on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

Optional:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--spec--volumes--label_selector))
- `match_label_keys` (List of String) MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for the incoming pod. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.
- `min_domains` (Number) MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread treats 'global minimum' as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so 'global minimum' is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew.This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `node_affinity_policy` (String) NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations. - Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy. This is a alpha-level feature enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
- `node_taints_policy` (String) NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included. - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy. This is a alpha-level feature enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

(So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.
- `generate_name` (String) GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will return a 409.Applied only if Name is not specified.

- `managed_fields` (Attributes List) ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like 'ci-cd'. The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--spec--volumes--vsphere_volume--volume_claim_template--metadata--managed_fields))
- `name` (String) Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
- `namespace` (String) Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the 'default' namespace, but 'default' is the canonical representation.

More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
- `owner_references` (Attributes List) List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected.

(see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--spec--volumes--vsphere_volume--volume_claim_template--metadata--owner_references))
- `resource_version` (String) An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
- `self_link` (String) Deprecated: selfLink is a legacy read-only field that is no longer populated by the system.
- `uid` (String) UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.Populated by the system. Read-only.

- `fields_type` (String) FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: 'FieldsV1'
- `fields_v1` (Map of String) FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set, or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats: 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item 'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.The exact format is defined in sigs.k8s.io/structured-merge-diff
- `manager` (String) Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.
- `operation` (String) Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry being created. The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.
- `subresource` (String) Subresource is the name of the subresource used to update that object, or empty string if the object was updated through the main resource. The value of this field is used to distinguish between managers, even if they share the same name. For example, a status update will be distinct from a regular update using the same manager name. Note that the APIVersion field is not related to the Subresource field and it always corresponds to the version of the main resource.
- `time` (String) Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

- `container_name` (String) Container name: required for volumes, optional for env vars
- `divisor` (String) Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.The serialization format is:''' <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>	(Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the '' case in <decimalSI>.)<digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= '+' | '-' <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei	(International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)<decimalSI>       ::= m | '' | k | M | G | T | P | E	(Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)<decimalExponent> ::= 'e' <signedNumber> | 'E' <signedNumber> '''No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.Before serializing, Quantity will be put in 'canonical form'. This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:- No precision is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.Examples:- 1.5 will be serialized as '1500m' - 1.5Gi will be serialized as '1536Mi'Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

If specified, the listed keys will be projected into the specified paths, and unlisted keys will not be present. If a key is specified which is not present in the Secret, the volume setup will error unless it is marked optional. Paths must be relative and may not contain the '..' path or start with '..'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--spec--volumes--vsphere_volume--items))
- `optional` (Boolean) optional field specify whether the Secret or its keys must be defined
- `secret_name` (String) secretName is the name of the secret in the pod's namespace to use. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#secret

### Nested Schema for `spec.job_template.spec.ttl_seconds_after_finished.spec.volumes.vsphere_volume.secret_name`

Required:

- `key` (String) key is the key to project.
- `path` (String) path is the relative path of the file to map the key to. May not be an absolute path. May not contain the path element '..'. May not start with the string '..'.

Optional:

- `mode` (Number) mode is Optional: mode bits used to set permissions on this file. Must be an octal value between 0000 and 0777 or a decimal value between 0 and 511. YAML accepts both octal and decimal values, JSON requires decimal values for mode bits. If not specified, the volume defaultMode will be used. This might be in conflict with other options that affect the file mode, like fsGroup, and the result can be other mode bits set.

Optional:

- `fs_type` (String) fsType is the filesystem type to mount. Must be a filesystem type supported by the host operating system. Ex. 'ext4', 'xfs', 'ntfs'. Implicitly inferred to be 'ext4' if unspecified.
- `read_only` (Boolean) readOnly defaults to false (read/write). ReadOnly here will force the ReadOnly setting in VolumeMounts.
- `secret_ref` (Attributes) LocalObjectReference contains enough information to let you locate the referenced object inside the same namespace. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--spec--volumes--vsphere_volume--secret_ref))
- `volume_name` (String) volumeName is the human-readable name of the StorageOS volume.  Volume names are only unique within a namespace.
- `volume_namespace` (String) volumeNamespace specifies the scope of the volume within StorageOS.  If no namespace is specified then the Pod's namespace will be used.  This allows the Kubernetes name scoping to be mirrored within StorageOS for tighter integration. Set VolumeName to any name to override the default behaviour. Set to 'default' if you are not using namespaces within StorageOS. Namespaces that do not pre-exist within StorageOS will be created.

### Nested Schema for `spec.job_template.spec.ttl_seconds_after_finished`

Required:

- `rules` (Attributes List) A list of pod failure policy rules. The rules are evaluated in order. Once a rule matches a Pod failure, the remaining of the rules are ignored. When no rule matches the Pod failure, the default handling applies - the counter of pod failures is incremented and it is checked against the backoffLimit. At most 20 elements are allowed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--rules))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.job_template.spec.ttl_seconds_after_finished.rules`

Required:

- `action` (String) Specifies the action taken on a pod failure when the requirements are satisfied. Possible values are: - FailJob: indicates that the pod's job is marked as Failed and all  running pods are terminated.- Ignore: indicates that the counter towards the .backoffLimit is not  incremented and a replacement pod is created.- Count: indicates that the pod is handled in the default way - the  counter towards the .backoffLimit is incremented.Additional values are considered to be added in the future. Clients should react to an unknown action by skipping the rule.
- `on_pod_conditions` (Attributes List) Represents the requirement on the pod conditions. The requirement is represented as a list of pod condition patterns. The requirement is satisfied if at least one pattern matches an actual pod condition. At most 20 elements are allowed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--rules--on_pod_conditions))

Optional:

- `on_exit_codes` (Attributes) PodFailurePolicyOnExitCodesRequirement describes the requirement for handling a failed pod based on its container exit codes. In particular, it lookups the .state.terminated.exitCode for each app container and init container status, represented by the .status.containerStatuses and .status.initContainerStatuses fields in the Pod status, respectively. Containers completed with success (exit code 0) are excluded from the requirement check. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--job_template--spec--ttl_seconds_after_finished--rules--on_exit_codes))

### Nested Schema for `spec.job_template.spec.ttl_seconds_after_finished.rules.on_exit_codes`

Required:

- `status` (String) Specifies the required Pod condition status. To match a pod condition it is required that the specified status equals the pod condition status. Defaults to True.

Possible values are: - In: the requirement is satisfied if at least one container exit code  (might be multiple if there are multiple containers not restricted  by the 'containerName' field) is in the set of specified values.- NotIn: the requirement is satisfied if at least one container exit code  (might be multiple if there are multiple containers not restricted  by the 'containerName' field) is not in the set of specified values.Additional values are considered to be added in the future. Clients should react to an unknown operator by assuming the requirement is not satisfied.
- `values` (List of String) Specifies the set of values. Each returned container exit code (might be multiple in case of multiple containers) is checked against this set of values with respect to the operator. The list of values must be ordered and must not contain duplicates. Value '0' cannot be used for the In operator. At least one element is required. At most 255 elements are allowed.

Optional:

- `container_name` (String) Restricts the check for exit codes to the container with the specified name. When null, the rule applies to all containers. When specified, it should match one the container or initContainer names in the pod template.
