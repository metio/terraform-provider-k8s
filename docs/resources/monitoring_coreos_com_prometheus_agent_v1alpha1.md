## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) Specification of the desired behavior of the Prometheus agent. More info: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Optional

- `field_manager` (Boolean) The name of the manager used to track field ownership. If not specified uses the value from the provider configuration.
- `force_conflicts` (Boolean) If `true`, server-side apply will force the changes against conflicts. If not specified uses the value from the provider configuration.
- `wait_for` (Attributes List) Wait for specific conditions after create/update of resources. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--wait_for))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.

<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `additional_args` (Attributes List) AdditionalArgs allows setting additional arguments for the 'prometheus' container.  It is intended for e.g. activating hidden flags which are not supported by the dedicated configuration options yet. The arguments are passed as-is to the Prometheus container which may cause issues if they are invalid or not supported by the given Prometheus version.  In case of an argument conflict (e.g. an argument which is already set by the operator itself) or when providing an invalid argument, the reconciliation will fail and an error will be logged. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--additional_args))
- `additional_scrape_configs` (Attributes) AdditionalScrapeConfigs allows specifying a key of a Secret containing additional Prometheus scrape configurations. Scrape configurations specified are appended to the configurations generated by the Prometheus Operator. Job configurations specified must have the form as specified in the official Prometheus documentation: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config. As scrape configs are appended, the user is responsible to make sure it is valid. Note that using this feature may expose the possibility to break upgrades of Prometheus. It is advised to review Prometheus release notes to ensure that no incompatible scrape configs are going to break Prometheus after the upgrade. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--additional_scrape_configs))
- `affinity` (Attributes) Defines the Pods' affinity scheduling rules if specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--affinity))
- `apiserver_config` (Attributes) APIServerConfig allows specifying a host and auth methods to access the Kuberntees API server. If null, Prometheus is assumed to run inside of the cluster: it will discover the API servers automatically and use the Pod's CA certificate and bearer token file at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--apiserver_config))
- `arbitrary_fs_access_through_s_ms` (Attributes) When true, ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor and Probe object are forbidden to reference arbitrary files on the file system of the 'prometheus' container. When a ServiceMonitor's endpoint specifies a 'bearerTokenFile' value (e.g.  '/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token'), a malicious target can get access to the Prometheus service account's token in the Prometheus' scrape request. Setting 'spec.arbitraryFSAccessThroughSM' to 'true' would prevent the attack. Users should instead provide the credentials using the 'spec.bearerTokenSecret' field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--arbitrary_fs_access_through_s_ms))
- `body_size_limit` (String) BodySizeLimit defines per-scrape on response body size. Only valid in Prometheus versions 2.45.0 and newer.
- `config_maps` (List of String) ConfigMaps is a list of ConfigMaps in the same namespace as the Prometheus object, which shall be mounted into the Prometheus Pods. Each ConfigMap is added to the StatefulSet definition as a volume named 'configmap-<configmap-name>'. The ConfigMaps are mounted into /etc/prometheus/configmaps/<configmap-name> in the 'prometheus' container.
- `containers` (Attributes List) Containers allows injecting additional containers or modifying operator generated containers. This can be used to allow adding an authentication proxy to the Pods or to change the behavior of an operator generated container. Containers described here modify an operator generated container if they share the same name and modifications are done via a strategic merge patch.  The names of containers managed by the operator are: * 'prometheus' * 'config-reloader' * 'thanos-sidecar'  Overriding containers is entirely outside the scope of what the maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour may break at any time without notice. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--containers))
- `enable_features` (List of String) Enable access to Prometheus feature flags. By default, no features are enabled.  Enabling features which are disabled by default is entirely outside the scope of what the maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour may break at any time without notice.  For more information see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/
- `enable_remote_write_receiver` (Boolean) Enable Prometheus to be used as a receiver for the Prometheus remote write protocol.  WARNING: This is not considered an efficient way of ingesting samples. Use it with caution for specific low-volume use cases. It is not suitable for replacing the ingestion via scraping and turning Prometheus into a push-based metrics collection system. For more information see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#remote-write-receiver  It requires Prometheus >= v2.33.0.
- `enforced_body_size_limit` (String) When defined, enforcedBodySizeLimit specifies a global limit on the size of uncompressed response body that will be accepted by Prometheus. Targets responding with a body larger than this many bytes will cause the scrape to fail.  It requires Prometheus >= v2.28.0.
- `enforced_label_limit` (Number) When defined, enforcedLabelLimit specifies a global limit on the number of labels per sample. The value overrides any 'spec.labelLimit' set by ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, Probe objects unless 'spec.labelLimit' is greater than zero and less than 'spec.enforcedLabelLimit'.  It requires Prometheus >= v2.27.0.
- `enforced_label_name_length_limit` (Number) When defined, enforcedLabelNameLengthLimit specifies a global limit on the length of labels name per sample. The value overrides any 'spec.labelNameLengthLimit' set by ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, Probe objects unless 'spec.labelNameLengthLimit' is greater than zero and less than 'spec.enforcedLabelNameLengthLimit'.  It requires Prometheus >= v2.27.0.
- `enforced_label_value_length_limit` (Number) When not null, enforcedLabelValueLengthLimit defines a global limit on the length of labels value per sample. The value overrides any 'spec.labelValueLengthLimit' set by ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, Probe objects unless 'spec.labelValueLengthLimit' is greater than zero and less than 'spec.enforcedLabelValueLengthLimit'.  It requires Prometheus >= v2.27.0.
- `enforced_namespace_label` (String) When not empty, a label will be added to  1. All metrics scraped from 'ServiceMonitor', 'PodMonitor', 'Probe' and 'ScrapeConfig' objects. 2. All metrics generated from recording rules defined in 'PrometheusRule' objects. 3. All alerts generated from alerting rules defined in 'PrometheusRule' objects. 4. All vector selectors of PromQL expressions defined in 'PrometheusRule' objects.  The label will not added for objects referenced in 'spec.excludedFromEnforcement'.  The label's name is this field's value. The label's value is the namespace of the 'ServiceMonitor', 'PodMonitor', 'Probe' or 'PrometheusRule' object.
- `enforced_sample_limit` (Number) When defined, enforcedSampleLimit specifies a global limit on the number of scraped samples that will be accepted. This overrides any 'spec.sampleLimit' set by ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, Probe objects unless 'spec.sampleLimit' is greater than zero and less than than 'spec.enforcedSampleLimit'.  It is meant to be used by admins to keep the overall number of samples/series under a desired limit.
- `enforced_target_limit` (Number) When defined, enforcedTargetLimit specifies a global limit on the number of scraped targets. The value overrides any 'spec.targetLimit' set by ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, Probe objects unless 'spec.targetLimit' is greater than zero and less than 'spec.enforcedTargetLimit'.  It is meant to be used by admins to to keep the overall number of targets under a desired limit.
- `excluded_from_enforcement` (Attributes List) List of references to PodMonitor, ServiceMonitor, Probe and PrometheusRule objects to be excluded from enforcing a namespace label of origin.  It is only applicable if 'spec.enforcedNamespaceLabel' set to true. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--excluded_from_enforcement))
- `external_labels` (Map of String) The labels to add to any time series or alerts when communicating with external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager). Labels defined by 'spec.replicaExternalLabelName' and 'spec.prometheusExternalLabelName' take precedence over this list.
- `external_url` (String) The external URL under which the Prometheus service is externally available. This is necessary to generate correct URLs (for instance if Prometheus is accessible behind an Ingress resource).
- `host_aliases` (Attributes List) Optional list of hosts and IPs that will be injected into the Pod's hosts file if specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--host_aliases))
- `host_network` (Boolean) Use the host's network namespace if true.  Make sure to understand the security implications if you want to enable it (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/).  When hostNetwork is enabled, this will set the DNS policy to 'ClusterFirstWithHostNet' automatically.
- `ignore_namespace_selectors` (Boolean) When true, 'spec.namespaceSelector' from all PodMonitor, ServiceMonitor and Probe objects will be ignored. They will only discover targets within the namespace of the PodMonitor, ServiceMonitor and Probe objec.
- `image` (String) Container image name for Prometheus. If specified, it takes precedence over the 'spec.baseImage', 'spec.tag' and 'spec.sha' fields.  Specifying 'spec.version' is still necessary to ensure the Prometheus Operator knows which version of Prometheus is being configured.  If neither 'spec.image' nor 'spec.baseImage' are defined, the operator will use the latest upstream version of Prometheus available at the time when the operator was released.
- `image_pull_policy` (String) Image pull policy for the 'prometheus', 'init-config-reloader' and 'config-reloader' containers. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#image-pull-policy for more details.
- `image_pull_secrets` (Attributes List) An optional list of references to Secrets in the same namespace to use for pulling images from registries. See http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/images#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--image_pull_secrets))
- `init_containers` (Attributes List) InitContainers allows injecting initContainers to the Pod definition. Those can be used to e.g.  fetch secrets for injection into the Prometheus configuration from external sources. Any errors during the execution of an initContainer will lead to a restart of the Pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/ InitContainers described here modify an operator generated init containers if they share the same name and modifications are done via a strategic merge patch.  The names of init container name managed by the operator are: * 'init-config-reloader'.  Overriding init containers is entirely outside the scope of what the maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour may break at any time without notice. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--init_containers))
- `label_limit` (Number) Per-scrape limit on number of labels that will be accepted for a sample. Only valid in Prometheus versions 2.45.0 and newer.

Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready)  This is an alpha field from kubernetes 1.22 until 1.24 which requires enabling the StatefulSetMinReadySeconds feature gate.
- `node_selector` (Map of String) Defines on which Nodes the Pods are scheduled.
- `override_honor_labels` (Boolean) When true, Prometheus resolves label conflicts by renaming the labels in the scraped data to 'exported_<label value>' for all targets created from service and pod monitors. Otherwise the HonorLabels field of the service or pod monitor applies.
- `override_honor_timestamps` (Boolean) When true, Prometheus ignores the timestamps for all the targets created from service and pod monitors. Otherwise the HonorTimestamps field of the service or pod monitor applies.
- `paused` (Boolean) When a Prometheus deployment is paused, no actions except for deletion will be performed on the underlying objects.
- `pod_metadata` (Attributes) PodMetadata configures labels and annotations which are propagated to the Prometheus pods. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--pod_metadata))

If 'spec.serviceMonitorSelector', 'spec.podMonitorSelector', 'spec.probeSelector' and 'spec.scrapeConfigSelector' are null, the Prometheus configuration is unmanaged. The Prometheus operator will ensure that the Prometheus configuration's Secret exists, but it is the responsibility of the user to provide the raw gzipped Prometheus configuration under the 'prometheus.yaml.gz' key. This behavior is *deprecated* and will be removed in the next major version of the custom resource definition. It is recommended to use 'spec.additionalScrapeConfigs' instead. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--pod_monitor_selector))

The Prometheus operator will ensure that the Prometheus configuration's Secret exists, but it is the responsibility of the user to provide the raw gzipped Prometheus configuration under the 'prometheus.yaml.gz' key. This behavior is *deprecated* and will be removed in the next major version of the custom resource definition. It is recommended to use 'spec.additionalScrapeConfigs' instead. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--service_monitor_selector))
- `shards` (Number) EXPERIMENTAL: Number of shards to distribute targets onto. 'spec.replicas' multiplied by 'spec.shards' is the total number of Pods created.  Note that scaling down shards will not reshard data onto remaining instances, it must be manually moved. Increasing shards will not reshard data either but it will continue to be available from the same instances. To query globally, use Thanos sidecar and Thanos querier or remote write data to a central location.  Sharding is performed on the content of the '__address__' target meta-label for PodMonitors and ServiceMonitors and '__param_target__' for Probes.  Default: 1

Any port which is listening on the default '0.0.0.0' address inside a container will be accessible from the network. Modifying this array with strategic merge patch may corrupt the data. For more information See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108255. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--containers--ports))

- `startup_probe` (Attributes) StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation.

- `stdin_once` (Boolean) Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false

The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
- `tty` (Boolean) Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false.
- `volume_devices` (Attributes List) volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--containers--volume_devices))
- `volume_mounts` (Attributes List) Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--containers--volume_mounts))

- `ephemeral` (Attributes) EphemeralVolumeSource to be used by the StatefulSet. This is a beta field in k8s 1.21 and GA in 1.15. For lower versions, starting with k8s 1.19, it requires enabling the GenericEphemeralVolume feature gate. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/ephemeral-volumes/#generic-ephemeral-volumes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage--ephemeral))
- `volume_claim_template` (Attributes) Defines the PVC spec to be used by the Prometheus StatefulSets. The easiest way to use a volume that cannot be automatically provisioned is to use a label selector alongside manually created PersistentVolumes. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage--volume_claim_template))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--storage--empty_dir"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.storage.empty_dir`

Optional:

- `medium` (String) medium represents what type of storage medium should back this directory. The default is '' which means to use the node's default medium. Must be an empty string (default) or Memory. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#emptydir
- `size_limit` (String) sizeLimit is the total amount of local storage required for this EmptyDir volume. The size limit is also applicable for memory medium. The maximum usage on memory medium EmptyDir would be the minimum value between the SizeLimit specified here and the sum of memory limits of all containers in a pod. The default is nil which means that the limit is undefined. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#emptydir


<a id="nestedatt--spec--storage--ephemeral"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.storage.ephemeral`

Optional:

- `volume_claim_template` (Attributes) Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume. The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the pod.  The name of the PVC will be '<pod name>-<volume name>' where '<volume name>' is the name from the 'PodSpec.Volumes' array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).  An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster.  This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes to the PVC after it has been created.  Required, must not be nil. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage--ephemeral--volume_claim_template))

Optional:

- `metadata` (Map of String) May contain labels and annotations that will be copied into the PVC when creating it. No other fields are allowed and will be rejected during validation.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--storage--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.storage.ephemeral.volume_claim_template.spec`

Optional:

- `access_modes` (List of String) accessModes contains the desired access modes the volume should have. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1

When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef, and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified. If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source))
- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty. There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified. * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--storage--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source_ref))
- `resources` (Attributes) resources represents the minimum resources the volume should have. If RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature is enabled users are allowed to specify resource requirements that are lower than previous value but must still be higher than capacity recorded in the status field of the claim.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--storage--volume_claim_template--status"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.storage.volume_claim_template.status`

Optional:

- `access_modes` (List of String) accessModes contains the actual access modes the volume backing the PVC has. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1
- `allocated_resources` (Map of String) allocatedResources is the storage resource within AllocatedResources tracks the capacity allocated to a PVC. It may be larger than the actual capacity when a volume expansion operation is requested. For storage quota, the larger value from allocatedResources and PVC.spec.resources is used. If allocatedResources is not set, PVC.spec.resources alone is used for quota calculation. If a volume expansion capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources is only lowered if there are no expansion operations in progress and if the actual volume capacity is equal or lower than the requested capacity. This is an alpha field and requires enabling RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--tolerations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.tolerations`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
- `value` (String) Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--topology_spread_constraints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.topology_spread_constraints`

Required:

- `max_skew` (Number) MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule', it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |   P   | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When 'whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway', it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
- `topology_key` (String) TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a 'bucket', and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is 'kubernetes.io/hostname', each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey is 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', each zone is a domain of that topology. It's a required field.
- `when_unsatisfiable` (String) WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location, but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the skew. A constraint is considered 'Unsatisfiable' for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate 'MaxSkew' on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

Optional:

- `label_selector` (Attributes) LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--topology_spread_constraints--label_selector))
- `match_label_keys` (List of String) MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector. MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.  This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `min_domains` (Number) MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread treats 'global minimum' as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so 'global minimum' is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew.  This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
- `node_affinity_policy` (String) NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations. - Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.  If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
- `node_taints_policy` (String) NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included. - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.  If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.volumes.ephemeral`

Optional:

- `volume_claim_template` (Attributes) Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume. The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the pod.  The name of the PVC will be '<pod name>-<volume name>' where '<volume name>' is the name from the 'PodSpec.Volumes' array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).  An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster.  This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes to the PVC after it has been created.  Required, must not be nil. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template))

Optional:

- `metadata` (Map of String) May contain labels and annotations that will be copied into the PVC when creating it. No other fields are allowed and will be rejected during validation.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.volumes.ephemeral.volume_claim_template.spec`

Optional:

- `access_modes` (List of String) accessModes contains the desired access modes the volume should have. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1

When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef, and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified. If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source))
- `data_source_ref` (Attributes) dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty. There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified. * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--volumes--ephemeral--volume_claim_template--spec--data_source_ref))
- `resources` (Attributes) resources represents the minimum resources the volume should have.
