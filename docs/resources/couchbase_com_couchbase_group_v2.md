## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) CouchbaseGroupSpec allows the specification of Couchbase group configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `roles` (Attributes List) Roles is a list of roles that this group is granted. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--roles))

Optional:

- `ldap_group_ref` (String) LDAPGroupRef is a reference to an LDAP group.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--roles"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.roles`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of role.

Optional:

- `bucket` (String) Bucket name for bucket admin roles.  When not specified for a role that can be scoped to a specific bucket, the role will apply to all buckets in the cluster. Deprecated:  Couchbase Autonomous Operator 2.3
- `buckets` (Attributes) Bucket level access to apply to specified role. The bucket must exist.  When not specified, the bucket field will be checked. If both are empty and the role can be scoped to a specific bucket, the role will apply to all buckets in the cluster (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--roles--buckets))
- `collections` (Attributes) Collection level access to apply to the specified role.  The collection must exist. When not specified, the role is subject to scope or bucket level access. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--roles--collections))
- `scopes` (Attributes) Scope level access to apply to specified role.  The scope must exist.  When not specified, the role will apply to selected bucket or all buckets in the cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--roles--scopes))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--roles--buckets"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.roles.buckets`

Optional:

- `resources` (Attributes List) Resources is an explicit list of named bucket resources that will be considered for inclusion in this role.  If a resource reference doesn't match a resource, then no error conditions are raised due to undefined resource creation ordering and eventual consistency. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--roles--buckets--resources))
- `selector` (Attributes) Selector allows resources to be implicitly considered for inclusion in this role.  More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.21/#labelselector-v1-meta (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--roles--buckets--selector))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--roles--buckets--resources"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.roles.buckets.selector`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name is the name of the Kubernetes resource name that is being referenced.

Optional:

<a id="nestedatt--spec--roles--buckets--selector"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.roles.buckets.selector`

Optional:

- `match_expressions` (Attributes List) matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--roles--buckets--selector--match_expressions))
- `match_labels` (Map of String) matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.

### Nested Schema for `spec.roles.buckets.selector.match_expressions`

- `operator` (String) operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

Optional:

- `values` (List of String) values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.
