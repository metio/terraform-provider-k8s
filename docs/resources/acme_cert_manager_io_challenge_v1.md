# k8s_acme_cert_manager_io_challenge_v1 (Resource)

Challenge is a type to represent a Challenge request with an ACME server

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "k8s_acme_cert_manager_io_challenge_v1" "big" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "test"
    namespace = "some-namespace"
    labels = {
      "test" = "abc"
    }
    annotations = {
      "try" = "this"
    }
  }
  spec = {
    authorization_url = "https://example.com/auth"
    dns_name          = "some-name"
    url               = "https://example.com"

Secret values should not be specified in this stanza. If secret values are needed (e.g. credentials for a DNS service), you should use a SecretKeySelector to reference a Secret resource. For details on the schema of this field, consult the webhook provider implementation's documentation.



<a id="nestedatt--spec--solver--http01"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.solver.http01`

Optional:

- `gateway_http_route` (Attributes) The Gateway API is a sig-network community API that models service networking in Kubernetes (https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/). The Gateway solver will create HTTPRoutes with the specified labels in the same namespace as the challenge. This solver is experimental, and fields / behaviour may change in the future. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--solver--http01--gateway_http_route))
- `ingress` (Attributes) The ingress based HTTP01 challenge solver will solve challenges by creating or modifying Ingress resources in order to route requests for '/.well-known/acme-challenge/XYZ' to 'challenge solver' pods that are provisioned by cert-manager for each Challenge to be completed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--solver--http01--ingress))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--solver--http01--gateway_http_route"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.solver.http01.ingress`

Optional:

- `labels` (Map of String) Custom labels that will be applied to HTTPRoutes created by cert-manager while solving HTTP-01 challenges.
- `parent_refs` (Attributes List) When solving an HTTP-01 challenge, cert-manager creates an HTTPRoute. cert-manager needs to know which parentRefs should be used when creating the HTTPRoute. Usually, the parentRef references a Gateway. See: https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/api-types/httproute/#attaching-to-gateways (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--solver--http01--ingress--parent_refs))
- `service_type` (String) Optional service type for Kubernetes solver service. Supported values are NodePort or ClusterIP. If unset, defaults to NodePort.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--solver--http01--ingress--parent_refs"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.solver.http01.ingress.parent_refs`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name is the name of the referent.  Support: Core

Optional:

- `group` (String) Group is the group of the referent.  Support: Core
- `kind` (String) Kind is kind of the referent.  Support: Core (Gateway)  Support: Custom (Other Resources)
- `namespace` (String) Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified (or empty string), this refers to the local namespace of the Route.  Support: Core
- `port` (Number) Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted differently based on the type of parent resource.  When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and select this Route). It's not recommended to set 'Port' unless the networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match both specified values.  Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources. Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly document how/if Port is interpreted.  For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.  Support: Extended  <gateway:experimental>
- `section_name` (String) SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:  * Gateway: Listener Name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match both specified values.  Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources. If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is interpreted.  When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource. For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.  Support: Core

- `namespace_selector` (Attributes) A label query over the set of namespaces that the term applies to. The term is applied to the union of the namespaces selected by this field and the ones listed in the namespaces field. null selector and null or empty namespaces list means 'this pod's namespace'. An empty selector ({}) matches all namespaces.

The term is applied to the union of the namespaces listed in this field and the ones selected by namespaceSelector. null or empty namespaces list and null namespaceSelector means 'this pod's namespace'.

### Nested Schema for `spec.solver.http01.ingress.pod_template.spec.tolerations`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
- `value` (String) Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

### Nested Schema for `spec.solver.selector`

Optional:

- `dns_names` (List of String) List of DNSNames that this solver will be used to solve. If specified and a match is found, a dnsNames selector will take precedence over a dnsZones selector. If multiple solvers match with the same dnsNames value, the solver with the most matching labels in matchLabels will be selected. If neither has more matches, the solver defined earlier in the list will be selected.
- `dns_zones` (List of String) List of DNSZones that this solver will be used to solve. The most specific DNS zone match specified here will take precedence over other DNS zone matches, so a solver specifying sys.example.com will be selected over one specifying example.com for the domain www.sys.example.com. If multiple solvers match with the same dnsZones value, the solver with the most matching labels in matchLabels will be selected. If neither has more matches, the solver defined earlier in the list will be selected.
- `match_labels` (Map of String) A label selector that is used to refine the set of certificate's that this challenge solver will apply to.
