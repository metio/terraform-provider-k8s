# k8s_traefik_containo_us_traefik_service_v1alpha1 (Resource)

TraefikService is the CRD implementation of a Traefik Service. TraefikService object allows to: - Apply weight to Services on load-balancing - Mirror traffic on services More info: https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v2.9/routing/providers/kubernetes-crd/#kind-traefikservice

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "k8s_traefik_containo_us_traefik_service_v1alpha1" "minimal" {
  metadata = {
    name = "test"
  }
  spec = {

  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) TraefikServiceSpec defines the desired state of a TraefikService. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

- `weight` (Number) Weight defines the weight and should only be specified when Name references a TraefikService object (and to be precise, one that embeds a Weighted Round Robin).
