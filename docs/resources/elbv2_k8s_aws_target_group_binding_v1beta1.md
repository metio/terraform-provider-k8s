## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) TargetGroupBindingSpec defines the desired state of TargetGroupBinding (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `service_ref` (Attributes) serviceRef is a reference to a Kubernetes Service and ServicePort. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--service_ref))
- `target_group_arn` (String) targetGroupARN is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the TargetGroup.

Optional:

- `ip_address_type` (String) ipAddressType specifies whether the target group is of type IPv4 or IPv6. If unspecified, it will be automatically inferred.
- `networking` (Attributes) networking defines the networking rules to allow ELBV2 LoadBalancer to access targets in TargetGroup. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking))
- `node_selector` (Attributes) node selector for instance type target groups to only register certain nodes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--node_selector))
- `target_type` (String) targetType is the TargetType of TargetGroup. If unspecified, it will be automatically inferred.

### Nested Schema for `spec.service_ref`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name is the name of the Service.
- `port` (Dynamic) Port is the port of the ServicePort.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--networking"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.networking`

Optional:

- `ingress` (Attributes List) List of ingress rules to allow ELBV2 LoadBalancer to access targets in TargetGroup. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking--ingress))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--networking--ingress"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.networking.ingress`

Required:

- `from` (Attributes List) List of peers which should be able to access the targets in TargetGroup. At least one NetworkingPeer should be specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking--ingress--from))
- `ports` (Attributes List) List of ports which should be made accessible on the targets in TargetGroup. If ports is empty or unspecified, it defaults to all ports with TCP. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking--ingress--ports))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--networking--ingress--from"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.networking.ingress.ports`

Optional:

- `ip_block` (Attributes) IPBlock defines an IPBlock peer. If specified, none of the other fields can be set. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking--ingress--ports--ip_block))
- `security_group` (Attributes) SecurityGroup defines a SecurityGroup peer. If specified, none of the other fields can be set. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--networking--ingress--ports--security_group))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--networking--ingress--ports--ip_block"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.networking.ingress.ports.ip_block`

Required:

- `cidr` (String) CIDR is the network CIDR. Both IPV4 or IPV6 CIDR are accepted.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--networking--ingress--ports--security_group"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.networking.ingress.ports.security_group`

Required:

- `group_id` (String) GroupID is the EC2 SecurityGroupID.



<a id="nestedatt--spec--networking--ingress--ports"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.networking.ingress.ports`

Optional:

- `port` (Dynamic) The port which traffic must match. When NodePort endpoints(instance TargetType) is used, this must be a numerical port. When Port endpoints(ip TargetType) is used, this can be either numerical or named port on pods. if port is unspecified, it defaults to all ports.
- `protocol` (String) The protocol which traffic must match. If protocol is unspecified, it defaults to TCP.




<a id="nestedatt--spec--node_selector"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.node_selector`

- `match_expressions` (Attributes List) matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--node_selector--match_expressions))
- `match_labels` (Map of String) matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.
