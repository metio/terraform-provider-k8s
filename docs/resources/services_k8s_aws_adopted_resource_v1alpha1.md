# k8s_services_k8s_aws_adopted_resource_v1alpha1 (Resource)

AdoptedResource is the schema for the AdoptedResource API.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "k8s_services_k8s_aws_adopted_resource_v1alpha1" "minimal" {
  metadata = {
    name = "test"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) AdoptedResourceSpec defines the desired state of the AdoptedResource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `aws` (Attributes) AWSIdentifiers provide all unique ways to reference an AWS resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--aws))
- `kubernetes` (Attributes) ResourceWithMetadata provides the values necessary to create a Kubernetes resource and override any of its metadata values. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--kubernetes))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--aws"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.aws`

Optional:

- `additional_keys` (Map of String) AdditionalKeys represents any additional arbitrary identifiers used when describing the target resource.
- `arn` (String) ARN is the AWS Resource Name for the resource. It is a globally unique identifier.
- `name_or_id` (String) NameOrId is a user-supplied string identifier for the resource. It may or may not be globally unique, depending on the type of resource.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--kubernetes"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.kubernetes`

Required:

- `group` (String)
- `kind` (String)

Optional:

- `metadata` (Attributes) ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create. It is not possible to use 'metav1.ObjectMeta' inside spec, as the controller-gen automatically converts this to an arbitrary string-string map. https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools/issues/385  Active discussion about inclusion of this field in the spec is happening in this PR: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools/pull/395  Until this is allowed, or if it never is, we will produce a subset of the object meta that contains only the fields which the user is allowed to modify in the metadata. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--kubernetes--metadata))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--kubernetes--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.kubernetes.metadata`

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
- `generate_name` (String) GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.  If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).  Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency
- `labels` (Map of String) Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
- `name` (String) Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
- `namespace` (String) Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the 'default' namespace, but 'default' is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.  Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
- `owner_references` (Attributes List) List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--kubernetes--metadata--owner_references))

### Nested Schema for `spec.kubernetes.metadata.owner_references`

Required:

- `api_version` (String) API version of the referent.
- `kind` (String) Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `name` (String) Name of the referent. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
- `uid` (String) UID of the referent. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

Optional:

- `block_owner_deletion` (Boolean) If true, AND if the owner has the 'foregroundDeletion' finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs 'delete' permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.
- `controller` (Boolean) If true, this reference points to the managing controller.
