## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) Spec represents the desired behavior. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Optional

- `field_manager` (Boolean) The name of the manager used to track field ownership. If not specified uses the value from the provider configuration.
- `force_conflicts` (Boolean) If `true`, server-side apply will force the changes against conflicts. If not specified uses the value from the provider configuration.
- `wait_for` (Attributes List) Wait for specific conditions after create/update of resources. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--wait_for))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.name`.

- `namespace` (String) Namespace represents the namespace for the referent. For non-namespace scoped resources(e.g. 'ClusterRole')ï¼Œdo not need specify Namespace, and for namespace scoped resources, Namespace is required. If Namespace is not specified, means the resource is non-namespace scoped.
- `replicas` (Number) Replicas represents the replica number of the referencing resource.
- `resource_per_replicas` (Map of String) ReplicaResourceRequirements represents the resources required by each replica.
- `resource_version` (String) ResourceVersion represents the internal version of the referenced object, that can be used by clients to determine when object has changed.
