# k8s_cilium_io_cilium_external_workload_v2 (Resource)

CiliumExternalWorkload is a Kubernetes Custom Resource that contains a specification for an external workload that can join the cluster.  The name of the CRD is the FQDN of the external workload, and it needs to match the name in the workload registration. The labels on the CRD object are the labels that will be used to allocate a Cilium Identity for the external workload. If 'io.kubernetes.pod.namespace' or 'io.kubernetes.pod.name' labels are not explicitly specified, they will be defaulted to 'default' and <workload name>, respectively. 'io.cilium.k8s.policy.cluster' will always be defined as the name of the current cluster, which defaults to 'default'.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "k8s_cilium_io_cilium_external_workload_v2" "minimal" {
  metadata = {
    name = "test"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) Spec is the desired configuration of the external Cilium workload. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `ipv4__alloc__cidr` (String) IPv4AllocCIDR is the range of IPv4 addresses in the CIDR format that the external workload can use to allocate IP addresses for the tunnel device and the health endpoint.
- `ipv6__alloc__cidr` (String) IPv6AllocCIDR is the range of IPv6 addresses in the CIDR format that the external workload can use to allocate IP addresses for the tunnel device and the health endpoint.
