### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `additional_certificate_authorities_secret_ref` (Attributes List) AdditionalCertificateAuthoritiesSecretRef is a list of references to secrets in the TargetNamespace that contain an additional Certificate Authority to use when communicating with target clusters. These certificate authorities will be used in addition to any self-signed CA generated by each cluster on installation. The cert data should be stored in the Secret key named 'ca.crt'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--additional_certificate_authorities_secret_ref))
- `argo_cd_config` (Attributes) ArgoCD specifies configuration for ArgoCD integration. If enabled, Hive will automatically add provisioned clusters to ArgoCD, and remove them when they are deprovisioned. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--argo_cd_config))
- `aws_private_link` (Attributes) AWSPrivateLink defines the configuration for the aws-private-link controller. It provides 3 major pieces of information required by the controller, 1. The Credentials that should be used to create AWS PrivateLink resources other than     what exist in the customer's account. 2. A list of VPCs that can be used by the controller to choose one to create AWS VPC Endpoints     for the AWS VPC Endpoint Services created for ClusterDeployments in their     corresponding regions. 3. A list of VPCs that should be able to resolve the DNS addresses setup for Private Link. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--aws_private_link))
- `backup` (Attributes) Backup specifies configuration for backup integration. If absent, backup integration will be disabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--backup))
- `controllers_config` (Attributes) ControllersConfig is used to configure different hive controllers (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--controllers_config))
- `delete_protection` (String) DeleteProtection can be set to 'enabled' to turn on automatic delete protection for ClusterDeployments. When enabled, Hive will add the 'hive.openshift.io/protected-delete' annotation to new ClusterDeployments. Once a ClusterDeployment has been installed, a user must remove the annotation from a ClusterDeployment prior to deleting it.
- `deprovisions_disabled` (Boolean) DeprovisionsDisabled can be set to true to block deprovision jobs from running.
- `disabled_controllers` (List of String) DisabledControllers allows selectively disabling Hive controllers by name. The name of an individual controller matches the name of the controller as seen in the Hive logging output.
- `export_metrics` (Boolean) ExportMetrics specifies whether the operator should enable metrics for hive controllers to be extracted for prometheus. When set to true, the operator deploys ServiceMonitors so that the prometheus instances that extract metrics. The operator also sets up RBAC in the TargetNamespace so that openshift prometheus in the cluster can list/access objects required to pull metrics.
- `failed_provision_config` (Attributes) FailedProvisionConfig is used to configure settings related to handling provision failures. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--failed_provision_config))
- `feature_gates` (Attributes) FeatureGateSelection allows selecting feature gates for the controller. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--feature_gates))
- `global_pull_secret_ref` (Attributes) GlobalPullSecretRef is used to specify a pull secret that will be used globally by all of the cluster deployments. For each cluster deployment, the contents of GlobalPullSecret will be merged with the specific pull secret for a cluster deployment(if specified), with precedence given to the contents of the pull secret for the cluster deployment. The global pull secret is assumed to be in the TargetNamespace. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--global_pull_secret_ref))
- `log_level` (String) LogLevel is the level of logging to use for the Hive controllers. Acceptable levels, from coarsest to finest, are panic, fatal, error, warn, info, debug, and trace. The default level is info.
- `maintenance_mode` (Boolean) MaintenanceMode can be set to true to disable the hive controllers in situations where we need to ensure nothing is running that will add or act upon finalizers on Hive types. This should rarely be needed. Sets replicas to 0 for the hive-controllers deployment to accomplish this.
- `managed_domains` (Attributes List) ManagedDomains is the list of DNS domains that are managed by the Hive cluster When specifying 'manageDNS: true' in a ClusterDeployment, the ClusterDeployment's baseDomain should be a direct child of one of these domains, otherwise the ClusterDeployment creation will result in a validation error. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--managed_domains))
- `metrics_config` (Attributes) MetricsConfig encapsulates metrics specific configurations, like opting in for certain metrics. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--metrics_config))
- `release_image_verification_config_map_ref` (Attributes) ReleaseImageVerificationConfigMapRef is a reference to the ConfigMap that will be used to verify release images.  The config map structure is exactly the same as the config map used for verification of release images for OpenShift 4 during upgrades. Therefore you can usually set this to the config map shipped as part of OpenShift (openshift-config-managed/release-verification).  See https://github.com/openshift/cluster-update-keys for more details. The keys within the config map in the data field define how verification is performed:  verifier-public-key-*: One or more GPG public keys in ASCII form that must have signed the                        release image by digest.  store-*: A URL (scheme file://, http://, or https://) location that contains signatures. These          signatures are in the atomic container signature format. The URL will have the digest          of the image appended to it as '<STORE>/<ALGO>=<DIGEST>/signature-<NUMBER>' as described          in the container image signing format. The docker-image-manifest section of the          signature must match the release image digest. Signatures are searched starting at          NUMBER 1 and incrementing if the signature exists but is not valid. The signature is a          GPG signed and encrypted JSON message. The file store is provided for testing only at          the current time, although future versions of the CVO might allow host mounting of          signatures.  See https://github.com/containers/image/blob/ab49b0a48428c623a8f03b41b9083d48966b34a9/docs/signature-protocols.md for a description of the signature store  The returned verifier will require that any new release image will only be considered verified if each provided public key has signed the release image digest. The signature may be in any store and the lookup order is internally defined.  If not set, no verification will be performed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--release_image_verification_config_map_ref))
- `service_provider_credentials_config` (Attributes) ServiceProviderCredentialsConfig is used to configure credentials related to being a service provider on various cloud platforms. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--service_provider_credentials_config))
- `sync_set_reapply_interval` (String) SyncSetReapplyInterval is a string duration indicating how much time must pass before SyncSet resources will be reapplied. The default reapply interval is two hours.
- `target_namespace` (String) TargetNamespace is the namespace where the core Hive components should be run. Defaults to 'hive'. Will be created if it does not already exist. All resource references in HiveConfig can be assumed to be in the TargetNamespace. NOTE: Whereas it is possible to edit this value, causing hive to 'move' its core components to the new namespace, the old namespace is not deleted, as it will still contain resources created by kubernetes and/or other OpenShift controllers.
