# k8s_chaos_mesh_org_status_check_v1alpha1 (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "k8s_chaos_mesh_org_status_check_v1alpha1" "example" {
  metadata = {

    namespace = "some-namespace"

  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) Spec defines the behavior of a status check (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Optional

- `field_manager` (Boolean) The name of the manager used to track field ownership. If not specified uses the value from the provider configuration.
- `force_conflicts` (Boolean) If `true`, server-side apply will force the changes against conflicts. If not specified uses the value from the provider configuration.
- `wait_for` (Attributes List) Wait for specific conditions after create/update of resources. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--wait_for))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `type` (String) Type defines the specific status check type. Support type: HTTP

Optional:

- `duration` (String) Duration defines the duration of the whole status check if the number of failed execution does not exceed the failure threshold. Duration is available to both 'Synchronous' and 'Continuous' mode. A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as '300ms', '-1.5h' or '2h45m'. Valid time units are 'ns', 'us' (or 'Âµs'), 'ms', 's', 'm', 'h'.
- `failure_threshold` (Number) FailureThreshold defines the minimum consecutive failure for the status check to be considered failed.
- `http` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--http))
- `interval_seconds` (Number) IntervalSeconds defines how often (in seconds) to perform an execution of status check.
- `mode` (String) Mode defines the execution mode of the status check. Support type: Synchronous / Continuous
- `records_history_limit` (Number) RecordsHistoryLimit defines the number of record to retain.
- `success_threshold` (Number) SuccessThreshold defines the minimum consecutive successes for the status check to be considered successful. SuccessThreshold only works for 'Synchronous' mode.
- `timeout_seconds` (Number) TimeoutSeconds defines the number of seconds after which an execution of status check times out.

### Nested Schema for `spec.http`

Required:

- `criteria` (Attributes) Criteria defines how to determine the result of the status check. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--http--criteria))
- `url` (String)

Optional:

- `body` (String)
- `headers` (Map of List of String) A Header represents the key-value pairs in an HTTP header.  The keys should be in canonical form, as returned by CanonicalHeaderKey.
- `method` (String)

<a id="nestedatt--spec--http--criteria"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.http.criteria`

Required:

- `status_code` (String) StatusCode defines the expected http status code for the request. A statusCode string could be a single code (e.g. 200), or an inclusive range (e.g. 200-400, both '200' and '400' are included).




<a id="nestedatt--wait_for"></a>
### Nested Schema for `wait_for`

Required:

- `jsonpath` (String) Relaxed JSONPath expression to use. See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/kubectl/pkg/cmd/get#RelaxedJSONPathExpression for details.

Optional:

- `timeout` (String) The length of time to wait before giving up. Zero means check once and don't wait, negative means wait for a week.
- `value` (String) The value to wait for. If not specified, waiting will complete as soon as JSONPath expression exists and has any non-empty value.
