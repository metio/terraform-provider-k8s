## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) This is the CRD for the resources called Kiali CRs. The Kiali Operator will watch for resources of this type and when it detects a Kiali CR has been added, deleted, or modified, it will install, uninstall, and update the associated Kiali Server installation. The settings here will configure the Kiali Server as well as the Kiali Operator. All of these settings will be stored in the Kiali ConfigMap. Do not modify the ConfigMap; it will be managed by the Kiali Operator. Only modify the Kiali CR when you want to change a configuration setting. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `additional_display_details` (Attributes List) A list of additional details that Kiali will look for in annotations. When found on any workload or service, Kiali will display the additional details in the respective workload or service details page. This is typically used to inject some CI metadata or documentation links into Kiali views. For example, by default, Kiali will recognize these annotations on a service or workload (e.g. a Deployment, StatefulSet, etc.):'''annotations:  kiali.io/api-spec: http://list/to/my/api/doc  kiali.io/api-type: rest'''Note that if you change this setting for your own custom annotations, keep in mind that it would override the current default. So you would have to add the default setting as shown in the example CR if you want to preserve the default links. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--additional_display_details))
- `api` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--api))
- `auth` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--auth))
- `custom_dashboards` (List of Map of String) A list of user-defined custom monitoring dashboards that you can use to generate metrics chartsfor your applications. The server has some built-in dashboards; if you define a custom dashboard herewith the same name as a built-in dashboard, your custom dashboard takes precedence and will overwritethe built-in dashboard. You can disable one or more of the built-in dashboards by simply defining anempty dashboard.An example of an additional user-defined dashboard,'''- name: myapp  title: My App Metrics  items:  - chart:      name: 'Thread Count'      spans: 4      metricName: 'thread-count'      dataType: 'raw''''An example of disabling a built-in dashboard (in this case, disabling the Envoy dashboard),'''- name: envoy'''To learn more about custom monitoring dashboards, see the documentation at https://kiali.io/docs/configuration/custom-dashboard/
- `deployment` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--deployment))
- `external_services` (Attributes) These external service configuration settings define how to connect to the external serviceslike Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger.Regarding sensitive values in the external_services 'auth' sections:Some external services configured below support an 'auth' sub-section in order to tell Kialihow it should authenticate with the external services. Credentials used to authenticate Kialito those external services can be defined in the 'auth.password' and 'auth.token' valueswithin the 'auth' sub-section. Because these are sensitive values, you may not want to declarethe actual credentials here in the Kiali CR. In this case, you may store the actual passwordor token string in a Kubernetes secret. If you do, you need to set the 'auth.password' or'auth.token' to a value in the format 'secret:<secretName>:<secretKey>' where '<secretName>'is the name of the secret object that Kiali can access, and '<secretKey>' is the name of thekey within the named secret that contains the actual password or token string. For example,if Grafana requires a password, you can store that password in a secret named 'myGrafanaCredentials'in a key named 'myGrafanaPw'. In this case, you would set 'external_services.grafana.auth.password'to 'secret:myGrafanaCredentials:myGrafanaPw'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--external_services))
- `health_config` (Attributes) This section defines what it means for nodes to be healthy. For more details, see https://kiali.io/docs/configuration/health/ (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--health_config))
- `identity` (Attributes) Settings that define the Kiali server identity. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--identity))
- `installation_tag` (String) Tag used to identify a particular instance/installation of the Kiali server. This is merely a human-readable string that will be used within Kiali to help a user identify the Kiali being used (e.g. in the Kiali UI title bar). See 'deployment.instance_name' for the setting used to customize Kiali resource names that are created.
- `istio_labels` (Attributes) Defines specific labels used by Istio that Kiali needs to know about. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--istio_labels))
- `istio_namespace` (String) The namespace where Istio is installed. If left empty, it is assumed to be the same namespace as where Kiali is installed (i.e. 'deployment.namespace').
- `kiali_feature_flags` (Attributes) Kiali features that can be enabled or disabled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--kiali_feature_flags))
- `kubernetes_config` (Attributes) Configuration of Kiali's access of the Kubernetes API. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--kubernetes_config))
- `login_token` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--login_token))
- `server` (Attributes) Configuration that controls some core components within the Kiali Server. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--server))
- `version` (String) The version of the Ansible playbook to execute in order to install that version of Kiali.It is rare you will want to set this - if you are thinking of setting this, know what you are doing first.The only supported value today is 'default'.If not specified, a default version of Kiali will be installed which will be the most recent release of Kiali.Refer to this file to see where these values are defined in the master branch,https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/tree/master/playbooks/default-supported-images.ymlThis version setting affects the defaults of the deployment.image_name anddeployment.image_version settings. See the comments for those settingsbelow for additional details. But in short, this version setting willdictate which version of the Kiali image will be deployed by default.Note that if you explicitly set deployment.image_name and/ordeployment.image_version you are responsible for ensuring those settingsare compatible with this setting (i.e. the Kiali image must be compatiblewith the rest of the configuration and resources the operator will install).

<a id="nestedatt--spec--additional_display_details"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.additional_display_details`

Required:

- `annotation` (String) The name of the annotation whose value is a URL to additional documentation useful to the user.
- `title` (String) The title of the link that Kiali will display. The link will go to the URL specified in the value of the configured 'annotation'.

Optional:

- `icon_annotation` (String) The name of the annotation whose value is used to determine what icon to display. The annotation name itself can be anything, but note that the value of that annotation must be one of: 'rest', 'grpc', and 'graphql' - any other value is ignored.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--api"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.api`

- `include` (List of String) A list of namespaces to be included in the list of namespaces provided by the Kiali API and Kiali UI (if those namespaces exist). Regex is supported. An undefined or empty list is ignored. This does not affect explicit namespace access.
- `label_selector_exclude` (String) A Kubernetes label selector (e.g. 'myLabel=myValue') which is used for filtering out namespaceswhen fetching the list of available namespaces. This does not affect explicit namespace access.
- `label_selector_include` (String) A Kubernetes label selector (e.g. 'myLabel=myValue') which is used when fetching the list ofavailable namespaces. This does not affect explicit namespace access.If 'deployment.accessible_namespaces' does not have the special value of ''**''then the Kiali operator will add a new label to all accessible namespaces - that newlabel will be this 'label_selector_include' (this label is added regardless if the namespace matches the label_selector_exclude also).Note that if you do not set this 'label_selector_include' setting but 'deployment.accessible_namespaces'does not have the special 'all namespaces' entry of ''**'' then this 'label_selector_include' will be setto a default value of 'kiali.io/[<deployment.instance_name>.]member-of=<deployment.namespace>'where '[<deployment.instance_name>.]' is the instance name assigned to the Kiali installationif it is not the default 'kiali' (otherwise, this is omitted) and '<deployment.namespace>'is the namespace where Kiali is to be installed.



<a id="nestedatt--spec--auth"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.auth`

Optional:

- `openid` (Attributes) To learn more about these settings and how to configure the OpenId authentication strategy, read the documentation at https://kiali.io/docs/configuration/authentication/openid/ (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--auth--openid))
- `openshift` (Attributes) To learn more about these settings and how to configure the OpenShift authentication strategy, read the documentation at https://kiali.io/docs/configuration/authentication/openshift/ (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--auth--openshift))
- `strategy` (String) Determines what authentication strategy to use when users log into Kiali.Options are 'anonymous', 'token', 'openshift', 'openid', or 'header'.* Choose 'anonymous' to allow full access to Kiali without requiring any credentials.* Choose 'token' to allow access to Kiali using service account tokens, which controlsaccess based on RBAC roles assigned to the service account.* Choose 'openshift' to use the OpenShift OAuth login which controls access based onthe individual's RBAC roles in OpenShift. Not valid for non-OpenShift environments.* Choose 'openid' to enable OpenID Connect-based authentication. Your cluster is required tobe configured to accept the tokens issued by your IdP. There are additional requiredconfigurations for this strategy. See below for the additional OpenID configuration section.* Choose 'header' when Kiali is running behind a reverse proxy that will inject anAuthorization header and potentially impersonation headers.When empty, this value will default to 'openshift' on OpenShift and 'token' on other Kubernetes environments.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--auth--openid"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.auth.openid`

Optional:

<a id="nestedatt--spec--deployment"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.deployment`

Optional:

- `accessible_namespaces` (List of String) A list of namespaces Kiali is to be given access to. These namespaces have service mesh components that are to be observed by Kiali. You can provide names using regex expressions matched against all namespaces the operator can see. The default makes all namespaces accessible except for some internal namespaces that typically should be ignored. NOTE! If this has an entry with the special value of ''**'' (two asterisks), that will denote you want Kiali to be given access to all namespaces via a single cluster role (if using this special value of ''**'', you are required to have already granted the operator permissions to create cluster roles and cluster role bindings).
- `additional_service_yaml` (Dynamic) Additional custom yaml to add to the service definition. This is used mainly to customize the service type. For example, if the 'deployment.service_type' is set to 'LoadBalancer' and you want to set the loadBalancerIP, you can do so here with: 'additional_service_yaml: { 'loadBalancerIP': '78.11.24.19' }'. Another example would be if the 'deployment.service_type' is set to 'ExternalName' you will need to configure the name via: 'additional_service_yaml: { 'externalName': 'my.kiali.example.com' }'. A final example would be if external IPs need to be set: 'additional_service_yaml: { 'externalIPs': ['80.11.12.10'] }'
- `affinity` (Attributes) Affinity definitions that are to be used to define the nodes where the Kiali pod should be constrained. See the Kubernetes documentation on Assigning Pods to Nodes for the proper syntax for these three different affinity types. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--deployment--affinity))
- `configmap_annotations` (Dynamic) Custom annotations to be created on the Kiali ConfigMap.
- `custom_secrets` (Attributes List) Defines additional secrets that are to be mounted in the Kiali pod.These are useful to contain certs that are used by Kiali to securely connect to third party systems(for example, see 'external_services.tracing.auth.ca_file').These secrets must be created by an external mechanism. Kiali will not generate these secrets; itis assumed these secrets are externally managed. You can define 0, 1, or more secrets.An example configuration is,'''custom_secrets:- name: mysecret  mount: /mysecret-path- name: my-other-secret  mount: /my-other-secret-location  optional: true''' (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--deployment--custom_secrets))
- `host_aliases` (Attributes List) This is content for the Kubernetes 'hostAliases' setting for the Kiali server.This allows you to modify the Kiali server pod '/etc/hosts' file.A typical way to configure this setting is,'''host_aliases:- ip: 192.168.1.100  hostnames:  - 'foo.local'  - 'bar.local''''For details on the content of this setting, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/network/customize-hosts-file-for-pods/#adding-additional-entries-with-hostaliases (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--deployment--host_aliases))
- `hpa` (Attributes) Determines what (if any) HorizontalPodAutoscaler should be created to autoscale the Kiali pod.A typical way to configure HPA for Kiali is,'''hpa:  api_version: 'autoscaling/v2'  spec:    maxReplicas: 2    minReplicas: 1    metrics:    - type: Resource      resource:        name: cpu        target:          type: Utilization          averageUtilization: 50''' (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--deployment--hpa))
- `image_digest` (String) If 'deployment.image_version' is a digest hash, this value indicates what type of digest it is. A typical value would be 'sha256'. Note: do NOT prefix this value with a '@'.
- `image_name` (String) Determines which Kiali image to download and install. If you set this to a specific name (i.e. you do not leave it as the default empty string), you must make sure that image is supported by the operator. If empty, the operator will use a known supported image name based on which 'version' was defined. Note that, as a security measure, a cluster admin may have configured the Kiali operator to ignore this setting. A cluster admin may do this to ensure the Kiali operator only installs a single, specific Kiali version, thus this setting may have no effect depending on how the operator itself was configured.
- `image_pull_policy` (String) The Kubernetes pull policy for the Kiali deployment. This is overridden to be 'Always' if 'deployment.image_version' is set to 'latest'.
- `image_pull_secrets` (List of String) The names of the secrets to be used when container images are to be pulled.
- `image_version` (String) Determines which version of Kiali to install.Choose 'lastrelease' to use the last Kiali release.Choose 'latest' to use the latest image (which may or may not be a released version of Kiali).Choose 'operator_version' to use the image whose version is the same as the operator version.Otherwise, you can set this to any valid Kiali version (such as 'v1.0') or any valid Kialidigest hash (if you set this to a digest hash, you must indicate the digest in 'deployment.image_digest').Note that if this is set to 'latest' then the 'deployment.image_pull_policy' will be set to 'Always'.If you set this to a specific version (i.e. you do not leave it as the default empty string),you must make sure that image is supported by the operator.If empty, the operator will use a known supported image version based on which 'version' was defined.Note that, as a security measure, a cluster admin may have configured the Kiali operator toignore this setting. A cluster admin may do this to ensure the Kiali operator only installsa single, specific Kiali version, thus this setting may have no effect depending on how theoperator itself was configured.
- `ingress` (Attributes) Configures if/how the Kiali endpoint should be exposed externally. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--deployment--ingress))
- `instance_name` (String) The instance name of this Kiali installation. This instance name will be the prefix prepended to the names of all Kiali resources created by the operator and will be used to label those resources as belonging to this Kiali installation instance. You cannot change this instance name after a Kiali CR is created. If you attempt to change it, the operator will abort with an error. If you want to change it, you must first delete the original Kiali CR and create a new one. Note that this does not affect the name of the auto-generated signing key secret. If you do not supply a signing key, the operator will create one for you in a secret, but that secret will always be named 'kiali-signing-key' and shared across all Kiali instances in the same deployment namespace. If you want a different signing key secret, you are free to create your own and tell the operator about it via 'login_token.signing_key'. See the docs on that setting for more details. Note also that if you are setting this value, you may also want to change the 'installation_tag' setting, but this is not required.
- `logger` (Attributes) Configures the logger that emits messages to the Kiali server pod logs. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--deployment--logger))
- `namespace` (String) The namespace into which Kiali is to be installed. If this is empty or not defined, the default will be the namespace where the Kiali CR is located.
- `node_selector` (Dynamic) A set of node labels that dictate onto which node the Kiali pod will be deployed.
- `pod_annotations` (Dynamic) Custom annotations to be created on the Kiali pod.
- `pod_labels` (Dynamic) Custom labels to be created on the Kiali pod.An example use for this setting is to inject an Istio sidecar such as,'''sidecar.istio.io/inject: 'true''''
- `priority_class_name` (String) The priorityClassName used to assign the priority of the Kiali pod.
- `replicas` (Number) The replica count for the Kiail deployment.
- `resources` (Dynamic) Defines compute resources that are to be given to the Kiali pod's container. The value is a dict as defined by Kubernetes. See the Kubernetes documentation (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container).If you set this to an empty dict ('{}') then no resources will be defined in the Deployment.If you do not set this at all, the default is,'''requests:  cpu: '10m'  memory: '64Mi'limits:  memory: '1Gi''''
- `secret_name` (String) The name of a secret used by the Kiali. This secret is optionally used when configuring the OpenID authentication strategy. Consult the OpenID docs for more information at https://kiali.io/docs/configuration/authentication/openid/
- `security_context` (Dynamic) Custom security context to be placed on the server container. The entire security context on the container will be the value of this setting if the operator is configured to allow it. Note that, as a security measure, a cluster admin may have configured the Kiali operator to not allow portions of this override setting - in this case you can specify additional security context settings but you cannot replace existing, default ones.
- `service_annotations` (Dynamic) Custom annotations to be created on the Kiali Service resource.
- `service_type` (String) The Kiali service type. Kubernetes determines what values are valid. Common values are 'NodePort', 'ClusterIP', and 'LoadBalancer'.
- `tolerations` (List of Map of String) A list of tolerations which declare which node taints Kiali can tolerate. See the Kubernetes documentation on Taints and Tolerations for more details.
- `verbose_mode` (String) DEPRECATED! Determines which priority levels of log messages Kiali will output. Use 'deployment.logger' settings instead.
- `version_label` (String) Kiali resources will be assigned a 'version' label when they are deployed.This setting determines what value those 'version' labels will have.When empty, its default will be determined as follows,* If 'deployment.image_version' is 'latest', 'version_label' will be fixed to 'master'.* If 'deployment.image_version' is 'lastrelease', 'version_label' will be fixed to the last Kiali release version string.* If 'deployment.image_version' is anything else, 'version_label' will be that value, too.
- `view_only_mode` (Boolean) When true, Kiali will be in 'view only' mode, allowing the user to view and retrieve management and monitoring data for the service mesh, but not allow the user to modify the service mesh.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--deployment--custom_secrets"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.deployment.custom_secrets`

Required:

- `mount` (String) The file path location where the secret content will be mounted. The custom secret cannot be mounted on a path that the operator will use to mount its secrets. Make sure you set your custom secret mount path to a unique, unused path. Paths such as '/kiali-configuration', '/kiali-cert', '/kiali-cabundle', and '/kiali-secret' should not be used as mount paths for custom secrets because the operator may want to use one of those paths.
- `name` (String) The name of the secret that is to be mounted to the Kiali pod's file system. The name of the custom secret must not be the same name as one created by the operator. Names such as 'kiali', 'kiali-cert-secret', and 'kiali-cabundle' should not be used as a custom secret name because the operator may want to create one with one of those names.

Optional:

- `optional` (Boolean) Indicates if the secret may or may not exist at the time the Kiali pod starts. This will default to 'false' if not specified.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--deployment--host_aliases"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.deployment.host_aliases`

Optional:

- `hostnames` (List of String)
- `ip` (String)


<a id="nestedatt--spec--deployment--hpa"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.deployment.hpa`

Optional:

- `api_version` (String) A specific HPA API version that can be specified in case there is some HPA feature you want to use that is only supported in that specific version. If value is an empty string, an attempt will be made to determine a valid version.
- `spec` (Dynamic) The 'spec' specified here will be placed in the created HPA resource's 'spec' section. If 'spec' is left empty, no HPA resource will be created. Note that you must not specify the 'scaleTargetRef' section in 'spec'; the Kiali Operator will populate that for you.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--deployment--ingress"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.deployment.ingress`

Optional:

- `additional_labels` (Dynamic) Additional labels to add to the Ingress (or Route if on OpenShift). These are added to the labels that are created by default; these do not override the default labels.
- `class_name` (String) If 'class_name' is a non-empty string, it will be used as the 'spec.ingressClassName' in the created Kubernetes Ingress resource. This setting is ignored if on OpenShift. This is also ignored if 'override_yaml.spec' is defined (i.e. you must define the 'ingressClassName' directly in your override yaml).
- `enabled` (Boolean) Determines if the Kiali endpoint should be exposed externally. If 'true', an Ingress will be created if on Kubernetes or a Route if on OpenShift. If left undefined, this will be 'false' on Kubernetes and 'true' on OpenShift.
- `override_yaml` (Attributes) Because an Ingress into a cluster can vary wildly in its desired configuration,this setting provides a way to override complete portions of the Ingress resourceconfiguration (Ingress on Kubernetes and Route on OpenShift). It is up to the userto ensure this override YAML configuration is valid and supports the cluster environmentsince the operator will blindly copy this custom configuration into the resource itcreates.This setting is not used if 'deployment.ingress.enabled' is set to 'false'.Note that only 'metadata.annotations' and 'spec' is valid and only they willbe used to override those same sections in the created resource. You can defineeither one or both.Note that 'override_yaml.metadata.labels' is not allowed - you cannot override the labels; to addlabels to the default set of labels, use the 'deployment.ingress.additional_labels' setting.Example,'''override_yaml:  metadata:    annotations:      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/secure-backends: 'true'      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: 'HTTPS'  spec:    rules:    - http:        paths:        - path: /kiali          pathType: Prefix          backend:            service              name: 'kiali'              port:                number: 20001''' (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--deployment--ingress--override_yaml))

When set to 'auto', Kiali will skip dashboards discovery for workloads with more than a configured threshold of pods (see 'discovery_auto_threshold'). When discovery is disabled or auto/skipped, it is still possible to tie workloads with dashboards through annotations on pods (refer to the doc https://kiali.io/docs/configuration/custom-dashboard/#pod-annotations). Value must be one of: 'true', 'false', 'auto'.

- `cache_token_namespace_duration` (Number) This Kiali cache is a list of namespaces per user. This is typically a short-lived cache compared with the duration of the namespace cache defined by the 'cache_duration' setting. This is specified in seconds.
- `excluded_workloads` (List of String) List of controllers that won't be used for Workload calculation. Kiali queries Deployment, ReplicaSet, ReplicationController, DeploymentConfig, StatefulSet, Job and CronJob controllers. Deployment and ReplicaSet will be always queried, but ReplicationController, DeploymentConfig, StatefulSet, Job and CronJobs can be skipped from Kiali workloads queries if they are present in this list.
- `qps` (Number) The QPS value of the Kubernetes client.

### Nested Schema for `spec.login_token`

Optional:

- `expiration_seconds` (Number) A user's login token expiration specified in seconds. This is applicable to token and header auth strategies only.
- `signing_key` (String) The signing key used to generate tokens for user authentication. Because this is potentially sensitive, you have the option to store this value in a secret. If you store this signing key value in a secret, you must indicate what key in what secret by setting this value to a string in the form of 'secret:<secretName>:<secretKey>'. If left as an empty string, a secret with a random signing key will be generated for you. The signing key must be 16, 24 or 32 byte long.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--server"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.server`

Optional:

- `address` (String) Where the Kiali server is bound. The console and API server are accessible on this host.
- `audit_log` (Boolean) When true, allows additional audit logging on write operations.
- `cors_allow_all` (Boolean) When true, allows the web console to send requests to other domains other than where the console came from. Typically used for development environments only.
- `gzip_enabled` (Boolean) When true, Kiali serves http requests with gzip enabled (if the browser supports it) when the requests are over 1400 bytes.
- `observability` (Attributes) Settings to enable observability into the Kiali server itself. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--server--observability))
- `port` (Number) The port that the server will bind to in order to receive console and API requests.
- `web_fqdn` (String) Defines the public domain where Kiali is being served. This is the 'domain' part of the URL (usually it's a fully-qualified domain name). For example, 'kiali.example.org'. When empty, Kiali will try to guess this value from HTTP headers. On non-OpenShift clusters, you must populate this value if you want to enable cross-linking between Kiali instances in a multi-cluster setup.
- `web_history_mode` (String) Define the history mode of kiali UI. Value must be one of: 'browser' or 'hash'.
- `web_port` (String) Defines the ingress port where the connections come from. This is usually necessary when the application responds through a proxy/ingress, and it does not forward the correct headers (when this happens, Kiali cannot guess the port). When empty, Kiali will try to guess this value from HTTP headers.
- `web_root` (String) Defines the context root path for the Kiali console and API endpoints and readiness probes. When providing a context root path that is not '/', do not add a trailing slash (i.e. use '/kiali' not '/kiali/'). When empty, this will default to '/' on OpenShift and '/kiali' on other Kubernetes environments.
- `web_schema` (String) Defines the public HTTP schema used to serve Kiali. Value must be one of: 'http' or 'https'. When empty, Kiali will try to guess this value from HTTP headers. On non-OpenShift clusters, you must populate this value if you want to enable cross-linking between Kiali instances in a multi-cluster setup.

### Nested Schema for `spec.server.observability`

Optional:

- `metrics` (Attributes) Settings that control how Kiali itself emits its own metrics. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--server--observability--metrics))
- `tracing` (Attributes) Settings that control how the Kiali server itself emits its own tracing data. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--server--observability--tracing))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--server--observability--metrics"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.server.observability.tracing`

Optional:

- `enabled` (Boolean) When true, the metrics endpoint will be available for Prometheus to scrape.
- `port` (Number) The port that the server will bind to in order to receive metric requests. This is the port Prometheus will need to scrape when collecting metrics from Kiali.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--server--observability--tracing"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.server.observability.tracing`

Optional:

- `collector_url` (String) The URL used to determine where the Kiali server tracing data will be stored.
- `enabled` (Boolean) When true, the Kiali server itself will product its own tracing data.
