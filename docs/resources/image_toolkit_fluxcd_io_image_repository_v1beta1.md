## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) ImageRepositorySpec defines the parameters for scanning an image repository, e.g., 'fluxcd/flux'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `access_from` (Attributes) AccessFrom defines an ACL for allowing cross-namespace references to the ImageRepository object based on the caller's namespace labels. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--access_from))
- `cert_secret_ref` (Attributes) CertSecretRef can be given the name of a secret containing either or both of  - a PEM-encoded client certificate ('certFile') and private key ('keyFile'); - a PEM-encoded CA certificate ('caFile')  and whichever are supplied, will be used for connecting to the registry. The client cert and key are useful if you are authenticating with a certificate; the CA cert is useful if you are using a self-signed server certificate. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--cert_secret_ref))
- `exclusion_list` (List of String) ExclusionList is a list of regex strings used to exclude certain tags from being stored in the database.
- `image` (String) Image is the name of the image repository
- `interval` (String) Interval is the length of time to wait between scans of the image repository.
- `secret_ref` (Attributes) SecretRef can be given the name of a secret containing credentials to use for the image registry. The secret should be created with 'kubectl create secret docker-registry', or the equivalent. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--secret_ref))
- `service_account_name` (String) ServiceAccountName is the name of the Kubernetes ServiceAccount used to authenticate the image pull if the service account has attached pull secrets.
- `suspend` (Boolean) This flag tells the controller to suspend subsequent image scans. It does not apply to already started scans. Defaults to false.
- `timeout` (String) Timeout for image scanning. Defaults to 'Interval' duration.

### Nested Schema for `spec.access_from`

Required:

- `namespace_selectors` (Attributes List) NamespaceSelectors is the list of namespace selectors to which this ACL applies. Items in this list are evaluated using a logical OR operation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--access_from--namespace_selectors))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--access_from--namespace_selectors"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.access_from.namespace_selectors`

Optional:

- `match_labels` (Map of String) MatchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.
