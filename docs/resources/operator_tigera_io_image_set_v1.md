# k8s_operator_tigera_io_image_set_v1 (Resource)

ImageSet is used to specify image digests for the images that the operator deploys. The name of the ImageSet is expected to be in the format '<variant>-<release>'. The 'variant' used is 'enterprise' if the InstallationSpec Variant is 'TigeraSecureEnterprise' otherwise it is 'calico'. The 'release' must match the version of the variant that the operator is built to deploy, this version can be obtained by passing the '--version' flag to the operator binary.

## Example Usage

```terraform

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) ImageSetSpec defines the desired state of ImageSet. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `images` (Attributes List) Images is the list of images to use digests. All images that the operator will deploy must be specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--images))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--images"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.images`

Required:

- `digest` (String) Digest is the image identifier that will be used for the Image. The field should not include a leading '@' and must be prefixed with 'sha256:'.
- `image` (String) Image is an image that the operator deploys and instead of using the built in tag the operator will use the Digest for the image identifier. The value should be the image name without registry or tag or digest. For the image 'docker.io/calico/node:v3.17.1' it should be represented as 'calico/node'
