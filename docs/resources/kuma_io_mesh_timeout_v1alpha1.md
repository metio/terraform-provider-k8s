## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `field_manager` (Boolean) The name of the manager used to track field ownership. If not specified uses the value from the provider configuration.
- `force_conflicts` (Boolean) If `true`, server-side apply will force the changes against conflicts. If not specified uses the value from the provider configuration.
- `spec` (Attributes) Spec is the specification of the Kuma MeshTimeout resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))
- `wait_for` (Attributes List) Wait for specific conditions after create/update of resources. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--wait_for))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.

Optional:

- `from` (Attributes List) From list makes a match between clients and corresponding configurations (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from))
- `to` (Attributes List) To list makes a match between the consumed services and corresponding configurations (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--to))

Optional:

- `kind` (String) Kind of the referenced resource

### Nested Schema for `spec.from.default`

Optional:

- `connection_timeout` (String) ConnectionTimeout specifies the amount of time proxy will wait for an TCP connection to be established. Default value is 5 seconds. Cannot be set to 0.
- `http` (Attributes) Http provides configuration for HTTP specific timeouts (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--http))
- `idle_timeout` (String) IdleTimeout is defined as the period in which there are no bytes sent or received on connection Setting this timeout to 0 will disable it. Be cautious when disabling it because it can lead to connection leaking. Default value is 1h.
