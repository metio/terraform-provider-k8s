## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) CronHotBackupSpec defines the desired state of CronHotBackup (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated.

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `hot_backup_template` (Attributes) Specifies the hot backup that will be created when executing a CronHotBackup. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--hot_backup_template))
- `schedule` (String) Schedule contains a crontab-like expression that defines the schedule in which HotBackup will be started. If the Schedule is empty the HotBackup will start only once when applied. --- Several pre-defined schedules in place of a cron expression can be used.
