## Schema

### Required

- `endpoints` (Attributes List) Endpoints is a list of coreCEPs packed in a CiliumEndpointSlice (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--endpoints))
- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `namespace` (String) Namespace indicate as CiliumEndpointSlice namespace. All the CiliumEndpoints within the same namespace are put together in CiliumEndpointSlice.

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

- `name` (String) Name indicate as CiliumEndpoint name.
- `named_ports` (Attributes List) NamedPorts List of named Layer 4 port and protocol pairs which will be used in Network Policy specs.  swagger:model NamedPorts (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--endpoints--named_ports))
- `networking` (Attributes) EndpointNetworking is the addressing information of an endpoint. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--endpoints--networking))
