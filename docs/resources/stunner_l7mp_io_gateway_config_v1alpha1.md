# k8s_stunner_l7mp_io_gateway_config_v1alpha1 (Resource)

GatewayConfig is the Schema for the gatewayconfigs API

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "k8s_stunner_l7mp_io_gateway_config_v1alpha1" "example" {
  metadata = {
    name      = "some-name"
    namespace = "some-namespace"

  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `field_manager` (Boolean) The name of the manager used to track field ownership. If not specified uses the value from the provider configuration.
- `force_conflicts` (Boolean) If `true`, server-side apply will force the changes against conflicts. If not specified uses the value from the provider configuration.
- `spec` (Attributes) GatewayConfigSpec defines the desired state of GatewayConfig (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))
- `wait_for` (Attributes List) Wait for specific conditions after create/update of resources. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--wait_for))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Contains the value `metadata.namespace/metadata.name`.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `auth_lifetime` (Number) AuthLifetime defines the lifetime of 'longterm' authentication credentials in seconds.
- `auth_ref` (Attributes) Note that externally set credentials override any inline auth credentials (AuthType, AuthUsername, etc.): if AuthRef is nonempty then it is expected that the referenced Secret exists and *all* authentication credentials are correctly set in the referenced Secret (username/password or shared secret). Mixing of credential sources (inline/external) is not supported. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--auth_ref))
- `auth_type` (String) AuthType is the type of the STUN/TURN authentication mechanism.
- `health_check_endpoint` (String) HealthCheckEndpoint is the URI of the form 'http://address:port' exposed for external HTTP health-checking. A liveness probe responder will be exposed on path '/live' and readiness probe on path '/ready'. The scheme ('http://') is mandatory, default is to enable health-checking at 'http://0.0.0.0:8086'.
- `load_balancer_service_annotations` (Map of String) LoadBalancerServiceAnnotations is a list of annotations that will go into the LoadBalancer services created automatically by the operator to wrap Gateways.  NOTE: removing annotations from a GatewayConfig will not result in the removal of the corresponding annotations from the LoadBalancer service, in order to prevent the accidental removal of an annotation installed there by Kubernetes or the cloud provider. If you really want to remove an annotation, do this manually or simply remove all Gateways (which will remove the corresponding LoadBalancer services), update the GatewayConfig and then recreate the Gateways, so that the newly created LoadBalancer services will contain the required annotations.
- `log_level` (String) LogLevel specifies the default loglevel for the STUNner daemon.
- `max_port` (Number) MaxRelayPort is the smallest relay port assigned for STUNner relay connections.
- `metrics_endpoint` (String) MetricsEndpoint is the URI in the form 'http://address:port/path' exposed for metric scraping (Prometheus). The scheme ('http://') is mandatory. Default is to expose no metric endpoint.
- `min_port` (Number) MinRelayPort is the smallest relay port assigned for STUNner relay connections.
- `password` (String) Password defines the 'password' credential for 'plaintext' authentication.
- `realm` (String) Realm defines the STUN/TURN authentication realm to be used for clients toauthenticate with STUNner.  The realm must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character. No other punctuation is allowed.
- `shared_secret` (String) SharedSecret defines the shared secret to be used for 'longterm' authentication.
- `stunner_config` (String) StunnerConfig specifies the name of the ConfigMap into which the operator renders the stunnerd configfile.
- `user_name` (String) Username defines the 'username' credential for 'plaintext' authentication.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--auth_ref"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.auth_ref`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name is the name of the referent.

Optional:

- `group` (String) Group is the group of the referent. For example, 'gateway.networking.k8s.io'. When unspecified or empty string, core API group is inferred.
- `kind` (String) Kind is kind of the referent. For example 'HTTPRoute' or 'Service'.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace is the namespace of the backend. When unspecified, the local namespace is inferred.  Note that when a namespace is specified, a ReferenceGrant object is required in the referent namespace to allow that namespace's owner to accept the reference. See the ReferenceGrant documentation for details.  Support: Core



<a id="nestedatt--wait_for"></a>
### Nested Schema for `wait_for`

Required:

- `jsonpath` (String) Relaxed JSONPath expression to use. See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/kubectl/pkg/cmd/get#RelaxedJSONPathExpression for details.

Optional:

- `timeout` (String) The length of time to wait before giving up. Zero means check once and don't wait, negative means wait for a week.
- `value` (String) The value to wait for. If not specified, waiting will complete as soon as JSONPath expression exists and has any non-empty value.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

{{codefile "shell" "/var/home/seb/git/metio/terraform-provider-k8s/development/examples/resources/k8s_stunner_l7mp_io_gateway_config_v1alpha1/import.sh"}}
