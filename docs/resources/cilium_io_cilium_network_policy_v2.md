<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `description` (String) Description is a free form string, it can be used by the creator of the rule to store human readable explanation of the purpose of this rule. Rules cannot be identified by comment.

- `egress_deny` (Attributes List) EgressDeny is a list of EgressDenyRule which are enforced at egress. Any rule inserted here will by denied regardless of the allowed egress rules in the 'egress' field. If omitted or empty, this rule does not apply at egress. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress_deny))
- `endpoint_selector` (Attributes) EndpointSelector selects all endpoints which should be subject to this rule. EndpointSelector and NodeSelector cannot be both empty and are mutually exclusive. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--endpoint_selector))
- `ingress` (Attributes List) Ingress is a list of IngressRule which are enforced at ingress. If omitted or empty, this rule does not apply at ingress. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--ingress))
- `ingress_deny` (Attributes List) IngressDeny is a list of IngressDenyRule which are enforced at ingress. Any rule inserted here will by denied regardless of the allowed ingress rules in the 'ingress' field. If omitted or empty, this rule does not apply at ingress. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--ingress_deny))

- `node_selector` (Attributes) NodeSelector selects all nodes which should be subject to this rule. EndpointSelector and NodeSelector cannot be both empty and are mutually exclusive. Can only be used in CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicies. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--node_selector))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--egress"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.egress`

Optional:

- `icmps` (Attributes List) ICMPs is a list of ICMP rule identified by type number which the endpoint subject to the rule is allowed to connect to.  Example: Any endpoint with the label 'app=httpd' is allowed to initiate type 8 ICMP connections. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--icmps))
- `to_cidr` (List of String) ToCIDR is a list of IP blocks which the endpoint subject to the rule is allowed to initiate connections. Only connections destined for outside of the cluster and not targeting the host will be subject to CIDR rules.  This will match on the destination IP address of outgoing connections. Adding a prefix into ToCIDR or into ToCIDRSet with no ExcludeCIDRs is equivalent. Overlaps are allowed between ToCIDR and ToCIDRSet.  Example: Any endpoint with the label 'app=database-proxy' is allowed to initiate connections to 10.2.3.0/24
- `to_cidr_set` (Attributes List) ToCIDRSet is a list of IP blocks which the endpoint subject to the rule is allowed to initiate connections to in addition to connections which are allowed via ToEndpoints, along with a list of subnets contained within their corresponding IP block to which traffic should not be allowed. This will match on the destination IP address of outgoing connections. Adding a prefix into ToCIDR or into ToCIDRSet with no ExcludeCIDRs is equivalent. Overlaps are allowed between ToCIDR and ToCIDRSet.  Example: Any endpoint with the label 'app=database-proxy' is allowed to initiate connections to 10.2.3.0/24 except from IPs in subnet 10.2.3.0/28. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--to_cidr_set))
- `to_endpoints` (Attributes List) ToEndpoints is a list of endpoints identified by an EndpointSelector to which the endpoints subject to the rule are allowed to communicate.  Example: Any endpoint with the label 'role=frontend' can communicate with any endpoint carrying the label 'role=backend'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--to_endpoints))
- `to_entities` (List of String) ToEntities is a list of special entities to which the endpoint subject to the rule is allowed to initiate connections. Supported entities are 'world', 'cluster' and 'host'
- `to_fqd_ns` (Attributes List) ToFQDN allows whitelisting DNS names in place of IPs. The IPs that result from DNS resolution of 'ToFQDN.MatchName's are added to the same EgressRule object as ToCIDRSet entries, and behave accordingly. Any L4 and L7 rules within this EgressRule will also apply to these IPs. The DNS -> IP mapping is re-resolved periodically from within the cilium-agent, and the IPs in the DNS response are effected in the policy for selected pods as-is (i.e. the list of IPs is not modified in any way). Note: An explicit rule to allow for DNS traffic is needed for the pods, as ToFQDN counts as an egress rule and will enforce egress policy when PolicyEnforcment=default. Note: If the resolved IPs are IPs within the kubernetes cluster, the ToFQDN rule will not apply to that IP. Note: ToFQDN cannot occur in the same policy as other To* rules.  The current implementation has a number of limitations: - The DNS resolution originates from cilium-agent, and not from the pods. Differences between the responses seen by cilium agent and a particular pod will whitelist the incorrect IP. - DNS TTLs are ignored, and cilium-agent will repoll on a short interval (5 seconds). Each change to the DNS data will trigger a policy regeneration. This may result in delayed updates to the policy for an endpoint when the data changes often or the system is under load. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--to_fqd_ns))
- `to_groups` (Attributes List) ToGroups is a directive that allows the integration with multiple outside providers. Currently, only AWS is supported, and the rule can select by multiple sub directives:  Example: toGroups: - aws:     securityGroupsIds:     - 'sg-XXXXXXXXXXXXX' (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--to_groups))
- `to_ports` (Attributes List) ToPorts is a list of destination ports identified by port number and protocol which the endpoint subject to the rule is allowed to connect to.  Example: Any endpoint with the label 'role=frontend' is allowed to initiate connections to destination port 8080/tcp (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--to_ports))
- `to_requires` (Attributes List) ToRequires is a list of additional constraints which must be met in order for the selected endpoints to be able to connect to other endpoints. These additional constraints do no by itself grant access privileges and must always be accompanied with at least one matching ToEndpoints.  Example: Any Endpoint with the label 'team=A' requires any endpoint to which it communicates to also carry the label 'team=A'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--to_requires))
- `to_services` (Attributes List) ToServices is a list of services to which the endpoint subject to the rule is allowed to initiate connections. Currently Cilium only supports toServices for K8s services without selectors.  Example: Any endpoint with the label 'app=backend-app' is allowed to initiate connections to all cidrs backing the 'external-service' service (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--egress--to_services))

- `api_key` (String) APIKey is a case-insensitive string matched against the key of a request, e.g. 'produce', 'fetch', 'createtopic', 'deletetopic', et al Reference: https://kafka.apache.org/protocol#protocol_api_keys  If omitted or empty, and if Role is not specified, then all keys are allowed.
- `api_version` (String) APIVersion is the version matched against the api version of the Kafka message. If set, it has to be a string representing a positive integer.  If omitted or empty, all versions are allowed.
- `client_id` (String) ClientID is the client identifier as provided in the request.  From Kafka protocol documentation: This is a user supplied identifier for the client application. The user can use any identifier they like and it will be used when logging errors, monitoring aggregates, etc. For example, one might want to monitor not just the requests per second overall, but the number coming from each client application (each of which could reside on multiple servers). This id acts as a logical grouping across all requests from a particular client.  If omitted or empty, all client identifiers are allowed.
- `role` (String) Role is a case-insensitive string and describes a group of API keys necessary to perform certain higher-level Kafka operations such as 'produce' or 'consume'. A Role automatically expands into all APIKeys required to perform the specified higher-level operation.  The following values are supported:  - 'produce': Allow producing to the topics specified in the rule  - 'consume': Allow consuming from the topics specified in the rule  This field is incompatible with the APIKey field, i.e APIKey and Role cannot both be specified in the same rule.  If omitted or empty, and if APIKey is not specified, then all keys are allowed.
- `topic` (String) Topic is the topic name contained in the message. If a Kafka request contains multiple topics, then all topics must be allowed or the message will be rejected.  This constraint is ignored if the matched request message type doesn't contain any topic. Maximum size of Topic can be 249 characters as per recent Kafka spec and allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, . and _.  Older Kafka versions had longer topic lengths of 255, but in Kafka 0.10 version the length was changed from 255 to 249. For compatibility reasons we are using 255.  If omitted or empty, all topics are allowed.

- `api_key` (String) APIKey is a case-insensitive string matched against the key of a request, e.g. 'produce', 'fetch', 'createtopic', 'deletetopic', et al Reference: https://kafka.apache.org/protocol#protocol_api_keys  If omitted or empty, and if Role is not specified, then all keys are allowed.
- `api_version` (String) APIVersion is the version matched against the api version of the Kafka message. If set, it has to be a string representing a positive integer.  If omitted or empty, all versions are allowed.
- `client_id` (String) ClientID is the client identifier as provided in the request.  From Kafka protocol documentation: This is a user supplied identifier for the client application. The user can use any identifier they like and it will be used when logging errors, monitoring aggregates, etc. For example, one might want to monitor not just the requests per second overall, but the number coming from each client application (each of which could reside on multiple servers). This id acts as a logical grouping across all requests from a particular client.  If omitted or empty, all client identifiers are allowed.
- `role` (String) Role is a case-insensitive string and describes a group of API keys necessary to perform certain higher-level Kafka operations such as 'produce' or 'consume'. A Role automatically expands into all APIKeys required to perform the specified higher-level operation.  The following values are supported:  - 'produce': Allow producing to the topics specified in the rule  - 'consume': Allow consuming from the topics specified in the rule  This field is incompatible with the APIKey field, i.e APIKey and Role cannot both be specified in the same rule.  If omitted or empty, and if APIKey is not specified, then all keys are allowed.
- `topic` (String) Topic is the topic name contained in the message. If a Kafka request contains multiple topics, then all topics must be allowed or the message will be rejected.  This constraint is ignored if the matched request message type doesn't contain any topic. Maximum size of Topic can be 249 characters as per recent Kafka spec and allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, . and _.  Older Kafka versions had longer topic lengths of 255, but in Kafka 0.10 version the length was changed from 255 to 249. For compatibility reasons we are using 255.  If omitted or empty, all topics are allowed.

- `node_selector` (Attributes) NodeSelector selects all nodes which should be subject to this rule. EndpointSelector and NodeSelector cannot be both empty and are mutually exclusive. Can only be used in CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicies. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--specs--node_selector))

<a id="nestedatt--specs--egress"></a>
### Nested Schema for `specs.egress`

Optional:

- `icmps` (Attributes List) ICMPs is a list of ICMP rule identified by type number which the endpoint subject to the rule is allowed to connect to.  Example: Any endpoint with the label 'app=httpd' is allowed to initiate type 8 ICMP connections. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--specs--egress--icmps))
- `to_cidr` (List of String) ToCIDR is a list of IP blocks which the endpoint subject to the rule is allowed to initiate connections. Only connections destined for outside of the cluster and not targeting the host will be subject to CIDR rules.  This will match on the destination IP address of outgoing connections. Adding a prefix into ToCIDR or into ToCIDRSet with no ExcludeCIDRs is equivalent. Overlaps are allowed between ToCIDR and ToCIDRSet.  Example: Any endpoint with the label 'app=database-proxy' is allowed to initiate connections to 10.2.3.0/24
- `to_cidr_set` (Attributes List) ToCIDRSet is a list of IP blocks which the endpoint subject to the rule is allowed to initiate connections to in addition to connections which are allowed via ToEndpoints, along with a list of subnets contained within their corresponding IP block to which traffic should not be allowed.

- `to_entities` (List of String) ToEntities is a list of special entities to which the endpoint subject to the rule is allowed to initiate connections. Supported entities are 'world', 'cluster' and 'host'
- `to_fqd_ns` (Attributes List) ToFQDN allows whitelisting DNS names in place of IPs. The IPs that result from DNS resolution of 'ToFQDN.MatchName's are added to the same EgressRule object as ToCIDRSet entries, and behave accordingly. Any L4 and L7 rules within this EgressRule will also apply to these IPs. The DNS -> IP mapping is re-resolved periodically from within the cilium-agent, and the IPs in the DNS response are effected in the policy for selected pods as-is (i.e. the list of IPs is not modified in any way). Note: An explicit rule to allow for DNS traffic is needed for the pods, as ToFQDN counts as an egress rule and will enforce egress policy when PolicyEnforcment=default. Note: If the resolved IPs are IPs within the kubernetes cluster, the ToFQDN rule will not apply to that IP. Note: ToFQDN cannot occur in the same policy as other To* rules.  The current implementation has a number of limitations: - The DNS resolution originates from cilium-agent, and not from the pods. Differences between the responses seen by cilium agent and a particular pod will whitelist the incorrect IP. - DNS TTLs are ignored, and cilium-agent will repoll on a short interval (5 seconds). Each change to the DNS data will trigger a policy regeneration. This may result in delayed updates to the policy for an endpoint when the data changes often or the system is under load. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--specs--egress--to_fqd_ns))
- `to_groups` (Attributes List) ToGroups is a directive that allows the integration with multiple outside providers. Currently, only AWS is supported, and the rule can select by multiple sub directives:  Example: toGroups: - aws:     securityGroupsIds:     - 'sg-XXXXXXXXXXXXX' (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--specs--egress--to_groups))
- `to_ports` (Attributes List) ToPorts is a list of destination ports identified by port number and protocol which the endpoint subject to the rule is allowed to connect to.  Example: Any endpoint with the label 'role=frontend' is allowed to initiate connections to destination port 8080/tcp (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--specs--egress--to_ports))
- `to_requires` (Attributes List) ToRequires is a list of additional constraints which must be met in order for the selected endpoints to be able to connect to other endpoints. These additional constraints do no by itself grant access privileges and must always be accompanied with at least one matching ToEndpoints.  Example: Any Endpoint with the label 'team=A' requires any endpoint to which it communicates to also carry the label 'team=A'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--specs--egress--to_requires))
- `to_services` (Attributes List) ToServices is a list of services to which the endpoint subject to the rule is allowed to initiate connections. Currently Cilium only supports toServices for K8s services without selectors.  Example: Any endpoint with the label 'app=backend-app' is allowed to initiate connections to all cidrs backing the 'external-service' service (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--specs--egress--to_services))

- `secret` (Attributes) Secret refers to a secret that contains the value to be matched against. The secret must only contain one entry. If the referred secret does not exist, and there is no 'Value' specified, the match will fail. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--specs--egress--to_ports--terminating_tls--http--path--secret))

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion is the version matched against the api version of the Kafka message. If set, it has to be a string representing a positive integer.  If omitted or empty, all versions are allowed.
- `client_id` (String) ClientID is the client identifier as provided in the request.  From Kafka protocol documentation: This is a user supplied identifier for the client application. The user can use any identifier they like and it will be used when logging errors, monitoring aggregates, etc. For example, one might want to monitor not just the requests per second overall, but the number coming from each client application (each of which could reside on multiple servers). This id acts as a logical grouping across all requests from a particular client.  If omitted or empty, all client identifiers are allowed.
- `role` (String) Role is a case-insensitive string and describes a group of API keys necessary to perform certain higher-level Kafka operations such as 'produce' or 'consume'. A Role automatically expands into all APIKeys required to perform the specified higher-level operation.  The following values are supported:  - 'produce': Allow producing to the topics specified in the rule  - 'consume': Allow consuming from the topics specified in the rule  This field is incompatible with the APIKey field, i.e APIKey and Role cannot both be specified in the same rule.  If omitted or empty, and if APIKey is not specified, then all keys are allowed.
- `topic` (String) Topic is the topic name contained in the message. If a Kafka request contains multiple topics, then all topics must be allowed or the message will be rejected.  This constraint is ignored if the matched request message type doesn't contain any topic. Maximum size of Topic can be 249 characters as per recent Kafka spec and allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, . and _.  Older Kafka versions had longer topic lengths of 255, but in Kafka 0.10 version the length was changed from 255 to 249. For compatibility reasons we are using 255.  If omitted or empty, all topics are allowed.

- `client_id` (String) ClientID is the client identifier as provided in the request.  From Kafka protocol documentation: This is a user supplied identifier for the client application. The user can use any identifier they like and it will be used when logging errors, monitoring aggregates, etc. For example, one might want to monitor not just the requests per second overall, but the number coming from each client application (each of which could reside on multiple servers). This id acts as a logical grouping across all requests from a particular client.  If omitted or empty, all client identifiers are allowed.
- `role` (String) Role is a case-insensitive string and describes a group of API keys necessary to perform certain higher-level Kafka operations such as 'produce' or 'consume'. A Role automatically expands into all APIKeys required to perform the specified higher-level operation.  The following values are supported:  - 'produce': Allow producing to the topics specified in the rule  - 'consume': Allow consuming from the topics specified in the rule  This field is incompatible with the APIKey field, i.e APIKey and Role cannot both be specified in the same rule.  If omitted or empty, and if APIKey is not specified, then all keys are allowed.
- `topic` (String) Topic is the topic name contained in the message. If a Kafka request contains multiple topics, then all topics must be allowed or the message will be rejected.  This constraint is ignored if the matched request message type doesn't contain any topic. Maximum size of Topic can be 249 characters as per recent Kafka spec and allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, . and _.  Older Kafka versions had longer topic lengths of 255, but in Kafka 0.10 version the length was changed from 255 to 249. For compatibility reasons we are using 255.  If omitted or empty, all topics are allowed.
