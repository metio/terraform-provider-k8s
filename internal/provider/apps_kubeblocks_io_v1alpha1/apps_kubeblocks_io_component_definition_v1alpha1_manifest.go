ComponentDefinitions also enable defining reactive behaviors of the Component in response to events, such as member join/leave, Component addition/deletion, role changes, switch over, and more.

													MarkdownDescription: "PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure, preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes or until the termination grace period is reached.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the X.Y.Z format:  - Use pre-release labels (e.g., -alpha, -beta) for versions that are not yet stable or ready for production use. - Use build metadata (e.g., +build.1) for additional version information if needed.
