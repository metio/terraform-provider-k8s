ReferenceGrant is not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create a 'producer' route for a Service in a different namespace from the Route.  There are two kinds of parent resources with 'Core' support:  * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile) * Service (Mesh conformance profile, experimental, ClusterIP Services only)  This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent resources.

It is valid to reference multiple distinct sections within the same parent resource, such as two separate Listeners on the same Gateway or two separate ports on the same Service.  It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation.

For example, Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.
