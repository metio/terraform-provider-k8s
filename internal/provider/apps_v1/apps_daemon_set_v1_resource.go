This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:- No precision is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.Examples:- 1.5 will be serialized as '1500m' - 1.5Gi will be serialized as '1536Mi'Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.",
