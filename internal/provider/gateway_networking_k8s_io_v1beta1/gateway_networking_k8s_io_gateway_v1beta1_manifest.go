When both listener and route specify hostnames, there MUST be an intersection between the values for a Route to be accepted. For more information, refer to the Route specific Hostnames documentation.  Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label ('*.') are interpreted as a suffix match. That means that a match for '*.example.com' would match both 'test.example.com', and 'foo.test.example.com', but not 'example.com'.  Support: Core",
